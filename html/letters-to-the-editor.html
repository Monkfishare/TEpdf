The highest-performing organisations build cultures where everyone sees themselves as a leader and behaves as such. That means, for example, being prepared to be held accountable, taking decisions, inspiring others, but also asking for help when you need it. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Managers, on the other hand, are critical in organisations to perform the specific role of ensuring that all team members have what they need to be successful in their role. The best corporate cultures will recognise that progression should not have to mean becoming a manager. There should always be two paths for progression, in management roles and in individual contributor ones.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Equally, the best cultures won’t see managers as being where the “authority” should sit. Organisations will instead look to devolve authority to where decisions are best made, which is generally with the people and teams involved in the work. “Turn the Ship Around” by David Marquet is a fantastic story of a nuclear submarine that went from worst to best in the fleet by pushing down decision-making, and moving from a leader-follower culture to a leader-leader one. As for chief executives, we must be both managers and leaders, but it is the style of leadership we adopt that will determine how successful our organisations are. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Michael Nabarro<br/></small>Chief executiveSpektrix<i><br/>London</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The essence of management and leadership is easily found in the writings of notable thinkers like Peter Drucker, Tom Peters and Warren Bennis. But if people actually studied them, the business-advice industry would grind to a halt. Columnists, writers, publishers and, by a large margin, expensive consulting firms have a huge existential interest in keeping leaders and managers feeling a bit inadequate. I say stay away from the yearly fads and study the masters.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Steve Tarr<br/></small>Fellow<br/>Drucker School of Management<i><br/>Claremont, California</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">I am generally wary of leaders, and will take the most uninspiring but efficient manager over any visionary leader.

Of course, there was that manager who threw job applications into the air and randomly picked up half of them to consider, because he wanted any new recruit “to be lucky”.

Mr Petro lost no time in reacting to your article. In separate tweets on X he argued that your prestigious publication used a flawed poll commissioned by the opposition. He countered that among the young his popularity grew from 46% in May to 52% in October.

Doctors in America regulate themselves, limiting the supply of practitioners, much like a medieval guild. They extract rents as they increase their own incomes far beyond those of physicians in any other country.

Although I appreciate four extra fluid ounces of beer as much as anyone, I must point out that antiquity is on the side of the colonies.
