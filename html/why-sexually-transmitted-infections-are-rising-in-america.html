Gonorrhoea rates were also declining. Fast-forward to today and syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia, three of the most common sexually transmitted infections (<small>STI</small>s), are hitting historic highs (see chart), especially among gay men and certain ethnic-minority groups. In 2021 gonorrhoea reached its highest level since 1991 and syphilis since 1990. Chlamydia’s rates have nearly doubled since 20 years ago. Even babies are being affected. On November 7th the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (<small>CDC</small>) announced that congenital syphilis—passed to babies from infected mothers—increased tenfold from 2012 to 2022.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="626" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20231111_USC372.png" srcset="../image/20231111_USC372.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Why is this happening? <small>STI</small>s have plagued humans since Biblical times. But when <small>HIV</small> was first identified in the United States in 1981, it was particularly devastating. Whereas most <small>STI</small>s have unpleasant symptoms (chlamydia and gonorrhoea can result in infertility in severe cases and syphilis can be deadly if left untreated), contracting <small>HIV</small> was a death sentence. In 1992 <small>HIV</small> was the leading cause of death among American men aged 25-44.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The fear of contracting <small>HIV</small> and dying from <small>AIDS</small> led to behavioural changes. People used condoms and got screened for <small>STI</small>s more frequently. Public-health programmes received more funding. And as people died from <small>AIDS</small>, there were fewer high-risk people alive to spread <small>STI</small>s, says Jay Varma, a professor at Weill Cornell Medicine. One study found that <small>AIDS</small>-associated mortality may have accounted for up to 50% of the decline in syphilis rates in the early 1990s.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Big improvements have since been made in <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/17/is-the-end-of-aids-in-sight"><small>HIV</small> prevention and treatment</a>. Those concerned about contracting <small>HIV </small>can take pre-exposure prophylaxis (<small>P</small>r<small>EP</small>), which reduces the chances of getting the virus, and contracting <small>HIV</small> is no longer a death sentence. Many people infected with <small>HIV</small> live long, healthy lives and only have to take a daily pill to manage the virus.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">With the arrival of <small>P</small>r<small>EP</small> and improved treatments, condoms fell out of favour and <small>STI</small>s began to rise. At the same time funding fell for <small>STI </small>clinics. Couple this with the rise of dating apps, which encourage casual and frequent hookups, and the conditions were perfect for <small>STI</small>s to spread. “[<small>P</small>r<small>EP</small>] has been getting all of the attention, all of the resources,” says Antón Castellanos Usigli, a lecturer at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. “We have largely forgotten…the other side of the coin.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">There is some hope for slowing the rise in infections. In October the <small>CDC </small>released draft guidelines for a “morning-after” pill for <small>STI</small>s. Known as doxycycline or doxy-<small>PEP</small>, the drug can be taken by men after unprotected sex to prevent infection.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Doxy-<small>PEP</small> may seem like a miracle, but over-use of antibiotics may make some diseases resistant to them. Gonorrhoea is especially hardy—a new antibiotic-resistant strain was recently detected in America. To the relief of public-health officials, a <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/11/01/a-new-gonorrhoea-drug-was-developed-by-a-non-profit-foundation">new drug for gonorrhoea</a> has entered phase three of clinical trials, but this antibiotic may in time become irrelevant too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"> Dr Varma says public-health officials should aspire to do more than just help people avoid and heal from <small>STI</small>s. The target should be “to have sex be infection-free”. He points to the strides made with <small>HIV</small> prevention and treatment, which few thought possible. “I think it’s aspirational, but I don’t think it’s totally unachievable.”<span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance" target="_blank">Checks and Balance</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.</i></p></div></section></body>
