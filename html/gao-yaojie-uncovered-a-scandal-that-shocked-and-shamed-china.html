They called it “the strange disease”. It made them weary and nauseous, spread a rash on their bodies and made sores grow in their mouths. And it made people vanish. Muscles and strength wasted away, so that men could no longer work the flat brown fields. Families dwindled and disappeared. Owners of new-built houses never moved in, leaving them empty. Some people, realising they were sick, simply ran away. Instead of crops, the fields sprouted mud-mound graves.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Local doctors were as puzzled as the victims. So in 1996 they called in Gao Yaojie to help. She was nearly 70 then, and technically she had retired. But her fund of medical knowledge, especially in obstetrics and female cancers, was formidable. She had always had a pretty good head on her shoulders. In 1950 she had been one of the first women to enter the Henan Medical School, walking with a limp which she never lost, because for six years as a child her feet had been bound to fit her for a daintier, idler life. Not for her, thank you.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">She identified the mystery illness with her first patient. It was <small>AIDS</small>, which was already prevalent in China’s big cities. The puzzle was how it had arrived here, in these remote rural places. The farm folk were not taking drugs or indulging in commercial sex. Her patient, though, had recently had a blood transfusion. <small>HIV</small>, the virus that causes <small>AIDS</small>, had come in that way.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Moreover it had come in officially. Mobile clinics had been sent by local government, on Beijing’s orders, to collect blood for hospitals and plasma for the market. There was always a shortage, so donors were told they could save China by giving some of their own. In return for 800cc they could get 45 yuan, enough to feed their families for a week. Half the donation, 400cc of blood, was injected back into them anyway. Donors lined up eagerly to oblige.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Soon enough, though, the trade was in the hands of “blood bosses”. Administration became slapdash. Equipment—centrifuges that separated plasma from blood, syringes and needles—was reused without being disinfected. The blood returned to arms was casually mixed up. At the same time, donors were not monitored. Some went several times a week, some twice a day. The result was the scene Dr Gao chanced on in one village: a young wife who had just hanged herself in front of her little son. She rushed to cut her down, but the body was already stiff. Nothing to be done.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">She naturally reported all this, loudly and often. But naming the disease caused fury among health officials in Henan. Their reputation was at stake. If <small>AIDS </small>was admitted, who would invest there? Local headmen refused to let their fiefs be “<small>AIDS</small> villages”. On every side, those in charge rushed to protect their careers and silence this meddling old woman. No one apologised or accepted responsibility. Instead, she was chased out of villages; but this only made her angrier and more determined.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Life had shaped her that way. In 1939 her landowner family had been driven by Communist guerrillas from Shandong into Henan, where they had to begin again. During the Cultural Revolution, as a capitalist “black element”, she was beaten up and paraded through the streets with a high papier mâché hat on her head and her shoes tied round her neck. She was imprisoned in the hospital morgue, and for seven years was made to clean toilets rather than practise gynaecology. After trying to kill herself with pills, and surviving, she vowed to spend her life helping others.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">That was why “Grandma Gao” kept going back to the villages. Over the next dozen years she visited more than 100, treating more than 1,000 families. She went as incognito as possible, in her dowdy dark secondhand clothes, and slept in the homes of the poor. No one paid her; she financed herself, draining  the family savings. No medicine she had could specifically treat <small>AIDS</small>, but she took along cough syrup, painkillers and diarrhoea tablets, to ease the symptoms, and fizzy drinks and sweets at Moon Festival. She did a lot of cuddling of infected children, to prove there was nothing to fear, arranged adoptions for <small>AIDS</small> orphans, and nagged local orphanages to accept them, which was uphill work.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Also in her bag were leaflets, printed at her own expense, about <small>AIDS</small> prevention. These were as unwanted as she was. Her phone was bugged, and she was followed. Even angrier now, she forged on. By 2003 she reckoned that 10m people in China had been infected with <small>AIDS</small> through blood-collection, 3m of them in Henan. It was a totally man-made catastrophe, the result of her own country’s penchant for “lies, fraud and fakery”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The central government, which at least acknowledged <small>AIDS</small> elsewhere, was little help to her in Henan. Blood-stations were banned, but the trade went briskly on, every night, in the back streets of the capital, Zhengzhou. Still the central government doubted her word. In 2003 she told a deputy prime minister, Wu Yi, that if she didn’t believe there was <small>AIDS</small> in the countryside she would rent a car herself, and take her there.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">By this time she was writing books about her work, but publishers in Henan were afraid to handle them. Although she was not allowed to speak to the press, she managed to tell her story to a reporter from the <i>New York Times</i>. In 2007 she even won an American award. But when she tried to go to Beijing to get a visa to travel abroad, Henan’s officials put her under house arrest.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">After 20 days they relented, and she went briefly to America. Two years later, she moved there for good. She could not adjust: never learning English, and so rarely leaving her flat in West Harlem. But at least her books could be published there. She also gave searing testimony, through an interpreter, to a congressional committee. Now she could freely speak truth to power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Having done that, she hoped to disappear. Her ashes would be scattered in the Yellow river and  flow away eastwards, body and name together. She would vanish as completely as those unknown villagers of Henan, before she had discovered them. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body>
