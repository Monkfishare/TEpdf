As India’s prime minister his few corporeal needs are attended to by the state. So what do you give a man who needs nothing? An exhibition at the National Gallery of Modern Art (<small>NGMA</small>) in Delhi has answers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In India, as elsewhere, gifts given to senior officials are held by the treasury. Since 2019 it has periodically auctioned them off, for the benefit of a scheme to clean up the Ganges river. The <small>NGMA</small> has put on display a selection of 113 objects (of a total of 912) presented to Mr Modi over the past year and available for purchase online. Catchily titled “E-auction of Mementos Presented to The Honorable Prime Minister”, the exhibition is a snapshot of what Indians think their prime minister is likeliest to appreciate.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The items fall into four categories. The first is objects that say something about the gift-giver. These include tribal art and traditional headgear. The second category contains religious and nationalist mementoes: sculptures of Hindu warrior-rulers who fought the Muslim Mughal empire, figurines of Hindu gods, models of temples, including one being built on top of a destroyed mosque in Ayodhya, which Mr Modi is expected to inaugurate before elections next year. The third category includes symbols of the government’s modernisation programme, such as replicas of a new airport and train, whose ribbons the prime minister has cut.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The last category contains images of Mr Modi, and is the highlight. Your correspondent counted seven portraits, as well as carvings and statues, including one entitled “<small>MODI</small>: Man of Development India”: yours for 8,700 rupees ($105). These depict various facets of Mr Modi’s public image. One picture shows him as a dutiful son seeking his mother’s blessing (priced at 48,600 rupees). Another as a man of piety, bathing in the Ganges (81,100 rupees). A third shows him lost in contemplation, channelling the spirit of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, an early Hindu nationalist (5,000 rupees). There is even a portrait of Mr Modi in the medium of millet grains, which his government is promoting (62,600 rupees). As the <small>NGMA</small>’s director, Temsunaro Tripathi, puts it, “There is something for everyone.” (Provided you like Mr Modi.) <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body>
