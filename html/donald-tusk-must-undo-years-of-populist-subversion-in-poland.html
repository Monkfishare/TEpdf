After losing an election in October, Poland’s hard-right Law and Justice (<small>P</small>i<small>S</small>) party finally ceded power on December 12th to a coalition headed by Donald Tusk, a veteran former prime minister. After <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> lost a vote of confidence in parliament, the party’s leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, took to the lectern to call Mr Tusk “a German agent”—a puerile insult <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> used throughout the campaign, referring to Mr Tusk’s German ancestry and his experience as president of the European Council.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A refusal to go gently is common among ousted populists. But it will only bolster Mr Tusk’s resolve. In a two-hour speech on December 12th, he promised to mend the rule of law in Poland and win back the favour of the European Union, and with it €60bn ($65bn) in withheld recovery funds. “No one can outplay me in the <small>EU</small>,” he quipped. The cabinet, sworn in on December 13th, includes tough old hands such as Radoslaw Sikorski, who will return as foreign minister, and Borys Budka, a former justice minister tapped to clear <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> cronies out of state firms. Mr Tusk is ready for a fight. He will need to be.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In its eight years in power, <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> plugged thousands of apparatchiks into courts, public media and state-owned companies, and siphoned off funds to benefit the party. In its final weeks in office, the party changed the rules in the Supreme Court to make it harder to oust illegally appointed judges. Mr Tusk’s new government is also hemmed in by Andrzej Duda, the president, who hails from <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> and can veto legislation. Mr Duda signed many of <small>P</small>i<small>S</small>’s legal reforms and may see unravelling them as challenging his own power. A presidential election is not expected until May 2025.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Another problem is the Constitutional Tribunal, which <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> packed with loyalists soon after coming to power in 2015. The opposition can use <small>EU</small> court judgments to remove immediately three judges whom <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> appointed illegally. But it will need to wait out the nine-year terms of the remaining judges. One of them, Krystyna Pawlowicz, has compared Mr Tusk to Hitler (she later apologised) and more recently said that Germany and the <small>EU</small> intend to liquidate Poland. The court can derail any of the new government’s laws.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The final task in fixing the judiciary will be dealing with some 2,200 judges who, courts have ruled, were appointed illegitimately. <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> changed the law in 2017 so that the National Council of the Judiciary (<small>NCJ</small>), which appoints justices, was selected by parliament. The <small>EU</small>’s top court has ruled that this violates judicial independence and that the appointments are void. But scrapping them all would wreak havoc. Many simply graduated from judicial academy at an unlucky time; the government may let them stay. Others who were hand-picked, often from non-judicial careers, by the <small>P</small>i<small>S</small>-controlled <small>NCJ</small> will probably be vetted again or fired.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Repairing the system is as delicate as a game of jackstraws, says Ewa Letowska, who was Poland’s first ombudsman and later a judge on the Constitutional Tribunal. Yet some moves are relatively simple. The government can end disciplinary cases against judges who opposed <small>P</small>i<small>S</small>’s reforms or enforced European law. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The winning coalition has already started to use its majority. Starting on November 28th it created several parliamentary commissions to investigate alleged <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> misdeeds, including corruption and the deploying of spyware against rivals. In its manifesto Mr Tusk’s party, Civic Coalition (<small>KO</small>), promised to hold accountable those it accuses of breaching the constitution—including the president, a former prime minister and the governor of the central bank.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Critics worry that Mr Tusk’s party lacks the necessary resolve. (In 2015, they recall, it missed a chance to prosecute Zbigniew Ziobro, who later became <small>PiS</small>’s fanatical justice minister.) But the government should avoid the appearance of vengefulness, warns Marcin Matczak, a law professor at the University of Warsaw. Criminal proceedings against populists, such as Donald Trump, often boost their popularity. A further challenge will be to rebuild public trust in the rule of law.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">To do so, the government will need to take back control of public media, which have become a crude propaganda outlet. The key obstacle here is the National Media Council, a body created by <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> in 2016 to appoint heads of public television and radio. Parliament could try replacing some of its members, or attempt to scrap it, relying on a court ruling that it is unconstitutional. Another route would be to liquidate the public media and bring in caretaker managers. (<small>P</small>i<small>S</small> tried to block this possibility by changing the media law on its last day in office, but may have botched the paperwork.) Journalists loyal to <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> are already accusing the new government of “purges”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Turning back the clock is not enough. It is a cliché in Poland to say that <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> had the right diagnosis but the wrong solutions. The judiciary was inefficient and mistrusted, but the party’s reforms have made it even slower and less fair. Mr Tusk could start with digitisation: Polish lawyers must still submit procedural documents by mail. Kamila Gasiuk-Pihowicz, an <small>MP</small> from <small>KO</small>, suggests<small> </small>encouraging more out-of-court settlements. Iustitia, an independent organisation of judges, proposes flattening the wage differences between levels of courts to prevent judges from leaving lower ones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For now, liberal Poles are optimistic about a democratic renaissance. Ms Gasiuk-Pihowicz thinks <small>P</small>i<small>S</small>’s attack on judicial independence has fostered an appreciation of the rule of law: “When viruses attack the body, it reacts by creating antibodies. It was the same in Poland.” Mr Tusk, who likens his coming task to wading into the muck of the Augean stables, is hoping the antibodies are strong. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body>
