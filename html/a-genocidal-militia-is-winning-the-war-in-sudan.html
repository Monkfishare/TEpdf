The West is focused on Ukraine’s counter-offensive, China’s war games and the war in Gaza. African leaders, preoccupied by their own domestic problems, have shown all the urgency of a camel crossing the Sahara.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The consequences of neglect are becoming starker. The conflict between erstwhile bedfellows—the Rapid Support Forces (<small>RSF</small>), a paramilitary group, and the Sudanese Armed Forces (<small>SAF</small>), the regular army—is destroying the state they seized together in 2021, in a coup aimed at preventing a transition to democratic government. The <small>IMF</small> forecasts that Sudan’s economy will shrink by nearly a fifth this year. The war is deepening geopolitical rivalries in north-east Africa and the Persian Gulf.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Sudan has the world’s largest number of internal refugees. About 6.3m have been displaced since April alone, adding to the 3.7m Sudanese who had already fled their homes in previous conflicts and the 1.1m foreigners who had taken refuge in Sudan. Some 1.4m Sudanese have fled to neighbouring countries since the war began. Aid agencies say that more than 6m people are “one step away from famine”. Two decades after ethnic cleansing in Darfur, a region in the west of the country about twice the size of Britain, there is again credible evidence of genocide—by the <small>RSF</small>, which metastasised from the Janjaweed militia that slaughtered black Africans in the 2000s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">And things could soon get worse. In recent weeks the <small>RSF</small> has chalked up several major victories. Military analysts suggest it could try to take the rest of the country. Conflict monitors fear more genocidal violence. For those paying attention, the stakes are only getting higher.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">When war broke out, many foresaw stalemate. Yet today the<small> RSF</small> is winning. In August, in a sign of the <small>RSF</small>’s tightening grip on Khartoum, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the <small>SAF</small>’s<small> </small>head, fled from his army headquarters in the capital. “Khartoum is not the capital city any more,” says Entisar Abdelsadig of Search for Common Ground, an international <small>NGO</small> based in Washington and Brussels. There is heavy fighting within the city. The <small>RSF</small> is reported to be close to capturing the army’s remaining positions in the capital.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="702" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20231118_MAM905.png" srcset="../image/20231118_MAM905.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Though the <small>SAF</small> controls most of the agricultural lands in the east and the oil terminal in Port Sudan on the Red Sea, the <small>RSF</small> has the gold mines in the west and control over the borders with Chad and the Central African Republic (<small>CAR</small>). It is extending its control of the oil pipeline from South Sudan, on which Sudan’s government depends for transit fees. In recent weeks the <small>RSF</small> has been sighted in White Nile and Gezira states, historically two of the army’s strongholds (see map).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The <small>RSF</small>’s gains have been most dramatic in Darfur. Since the end of the rainy season about a month ago it has taken three of the region’s five main cities. Major military bases have been captured by the group or deserted by <small>SAF</small> soldiers.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In October the <small>RSF</small> took Nyala, Sudan’s second-largest city and a staging post for arms from the <small>CAR</small>. <small>SAF</small> defences collapsed after a pitched battle with a <small> </small>force led by Abdelrahim Hamdan Dagalo, the brother and deputy of the <small>RSF</small>’s commander, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (better known as Hemedti). Three days of looting ensued. Salah al-Din Limouni, a lawyer in Nyala, says much of the city has been laid to waste. Residents are without electricity and water supplies are disrupted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In early November a renewed assault by the <small>RSF</small> brought the fall of a <small>SAF</small> garrison in the town of Ardamata, some 10km to the north of el-Geneina, the capital of west Darfur state. The attacks by the <small>RSF</small>’s new armed drones, which made short work of the army’s heavy artillery, followed clashes earlier in the war that had forced the <small>SAF</small> to retreat to its base.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">Mass murder</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Not for the first time, in the days that followed the <small>RSF</small> and allied Arab militias carried out a vicious campaign of killings against the local Masalit people, a black African ethnic group. Men were separated from women, rounded up and shot. Tribal leaders were arrested or assassinated. Videos show young men crawling on all fours as soldiers beat and whip them; some show bodies scattered on the streets. <small>UN</small> officials estimate that at least 800 people were killed; local monitors put the toll as high as 1,300. These attacks follow earlier systematic massacres in el-Geneina, peaking in June, that coincided with a mass exodus of refugees to Chad. The <small>UN</small> is investigating more than a dozen mass graves. The <small>RSF</small> denies any involvement in attacks on civilians and said it is “firmly against any abuses or violations against any person”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Zakia Zakaria Alsafi, a local journalist, says that the paramilitary troops headed to Adarmata after the army base had fallen, preventing Masalit men from leaving and “searching for people by name to be killed”. She says she saw 25 civilians being lined up and shot. Hafez Idris, a lawyer in Ardamata, says that at night the <small>RSF</small> has been burying the corpses that litter the street. “There are piles of bodies which are visible from outer space,” says Nathaniel Raymond, a conflict monitor at Yale University.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The<small> RSF</small> is at the gates of el-Fasher, North Darfur’s capital. Some of its troops are on the north side, terrifying locals and looting homes. All the while, a much larger force is closing in from the south. “They are mobilising,” warns Nimr Mohammed Abdul-Rahman, the state governor.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Meanwhile, the <small>SAF</small> is holed up in barracks. Supplies of water, food and medicine are running out. Frightened residents are trying to flee. If Mr Dagalo conquers el-Fasher he will be able to claim control of all of Darfur and to secure a critical route for supplies of fuel and arms from Libya. A Western diplomat adds: “It is a matter of time before it goes.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The presence of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of civilians displaced from other parts of Darfur, as well as heavily armed militias from the Zaghawa, another ethnically African group, raise the prospect of a humanitarian catastrophe in el-Fasher. “If there were to be a fight it would likely be very, very bloody and put civilians in grave peril,” warns the <small>UN</small>’s Toby Harward. Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, says an <small>RSF</small> attack would put hundreds of thousands in “extreme danger”.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">Death on the Nile</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The<small> RSF</small>’s advances in large part reflect the uneven support outsiders have given the two sides. The United Arab Emirates (<small>UAE</small>) reportedly provides the <small>RSF</small> with weapons, armoured vehicles and drones via Chad, though there has been a <small>UN</small> arms embargo on Darfur since the early 2000s. By one count there were 168 airlifts from the <small>UAE</small> between May and September. (The <small>UAE</small> has denied sending arms to “any of the warring parties”.) Anti-aircraft missiles, reportedly supplied by the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary outfit, have helped the <small>RSF</small> to erode the <small>SAF</small>’s advantage in air power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Though Egypt has sporadically helped its fellow military regime—most recently, say sources, by bombing a bridge used by the <small>RSF</small> in Khartoum—it has done much less than the Emiratis. Its government has been distracted by an economic crisis at home, which it wants the <small>UAE</small>’s help to fix, and then by the war in Gaza to its north.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">What might come next? Some analysts fear a “Libya scenario” where the country is cleft into two parts, one on either side of the Nile. Yet Hemedti may not settle for a landlocked Darfur and a shell-shocked capital. If the <small>RSF</small> takes Khartoum, then the next stop could be Port Sudan on the Red Sea, a key location for both the<small> RSF </small>and its Emirati backers. “The <small>RSF</small> cannot declare victory without access to the sea,” says Kholood Khair of Confluence Advisory, a Sudanese think-tank.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Even if the <small>RSF </small>makes further advances, however, its writ is unlikely to stretch across the whole country. Myriad smaller rebel groups would survive. The <small>SAF</small> will not evaporate; its hitherto reluctant backers may stiffen their backbone if the <small>SAF </small>is about to lose its de facto capital on the Red Sea. And the <small>RSF</small> militiamen are not exactly administrators. “They don’t have a governing strategy,” says Ms Khair. “They can rule but they can’t govern.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Anarchy, one way or another, would have profound consequences. A European diplomat describes a scenario in which a fractured Sudan is torn apart by a broader regional rivalry from the Gulf to the Horn of Africa. On one side there is a bloc backed by the <small>UAE</small>—potentially encompassing Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, the <small>RSF</small>’s Sudan, chunks of Somalia and Chad. On the other is a Saudi-supported camp, embracing the <small>SAF</small>’s Sudan, Djibouti, Eritrea and Egypt.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Cameron Hudson, a former American official,  imagines a scenario in which “tens of millions of Sudanese flee across the continent and the Red Sea to escape the country’s descent into warlordism and ethnic-militia violence.” Sudan’s ungoverned spaces could draw in jihadists, who are currently fighting in the Sahel, and Russian mercenaries who are keen to give the Kremlin its long-sought foothold in Port Sudan. (<small>CNN</small> has reported that, in response to Russian activity in Sudan, Ukraine’s special forces may have carried out missions against the <small>RSF</small>.) “While ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine have captured the attention of the world,” he argues, “the geopolitical ripple effects of Sudan’s collapse are being woefully underestimated.”</p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Amani Abdullah, a Sudanese woman mourns her husband in a refugee camp in Ourang, Chad" data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231118_MAP005.jpg" srcset="../image/20231118_MAP005.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">A land of widows</span><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Reuters</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">International efforts to try to stop the bloodshed have begun. Last month Saudi Arabia, alongside America, restarted talks in Jeddah between representatives of the <small>RSF</small> and the <small>SAF</small>. On paper there was an agreement to improve access for humanitarians. But it is hard to see how it has made much difference.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Fighting was raging in Darfur while the belligerent bigwigs talked in Saudi Arabia. The <small>RSF</small>,<small> </small>and, according to Emirati officials in private, its backers, see no point in a truce in a war it is winning. The <small>SAF</small>, meanwhile, maintains that its foe must disarm and withdraw to its bases. “There is a glaring mismatch between the weakness of [the <small>SAF</small>’s] military position and their hilarious maximalist negotiating position,” says another European diplomat.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">No expert thinks it is easy to find a deal that would suit such mendacious and self-interested combatants, never mind one that would also take account of the civilian victims of the generals’ greed. Even so, the international response has still been “anaemic and ad hoc”, says Mr Hudson. The <small>UN</small> Security Council is paralysed and the organisation’s leadership has shown far less interest in Sudan than it has in Gaza. A joint African Union (<small>AU</small>)-<small>UN</small> peacekeeping mission to Darfur withdrew in 2021 in the belief that blue helmets were no longer necessary. The <small>AU </small>and the continent’s leaders have been all but silent in the face of the sort of atrocities it once pledged to stop. <small>IGAD</small>, a regional group, has been weak, though Kenya’s president, William Ruto, is keen to resume its efforts. He met Mr Burhan in Nairobi on November 13th. Neither the <small>UAE</small> nor Egypt has taken part in the talks in Jeddah.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Western officials claim that they have not neglected the conflict, noting that the world is more complex than it was in the 2000s, when America could more easily lead international responses such as the one in Darfur and in what would become South Sudan. Yet it is hard to make the case that Sudan has attracted sufficient urgency or creativity. The White House has adopted a de facto “do not disturb us” policy, says Alex de Waal, a British researcher. Sudan is not going to be high on America’s agenda in its discussions with the <small>UAE</small> or Saudi Arabia, especially since Hamas erupted from Gaza on October 7th.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have drawn global attention. Meanwhile in Africa the grim effects of a huge state’s collapse are passing almost unnoticed. “Sudan has died,” says Mr Raymond. “And nobody wrote the obituary.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body>
