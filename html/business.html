The turmoil at the startup that developed the Chat<small>GPT</small> chatbot shook the artificial-intelligence industry. The reasons behind the sacking are still unclear, but are thought to have reflected a disagreement over the speed of the <small>AI</small> revolution. Almost all of Open<small>AI’</small>s staff threatened to quit if Mr Altman was not brought back. Microsoft, which owns a 49% stake in the firm, had offered to employ him. Larry Summers, an <i>éminence grise</i> and former American treasury secretary, will sit on the new board.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">America’s Department of Justice announced that <b><a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/22/another-crypto-boss-falls">Binance</a></b> had pleaded guilty to money-laundering and failing to comply with international sanctions, and would pay penalties amounting to $4.3bn. Changpeng Zhao, who founded the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, resigned as chief executive and pleaded guilty to related charges. The department said that over five years Binance had enabled nearly $1bn in illegal payments involving countries and individuals under sanctions, and simply ignored American law and safeguards.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Elon Musk tried to navigate a storm of criticism following his approval of an <b><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/23/what-survey-data-reveal-about-antisemitism-in-america">antisemitic</a> </b>trope posted on X. After the White House lashed out at his apparent endorsement of a “hideous” conspiracy theory, Mr Musk insisted he was not antisemitic. He also announced that users on X who apply the term “decolonisation” to Israel and other terms that imply the genocide of Jewish people would be suspended from the platform.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Meanwhile <b>X</b> sued Media Matters for America, a pressure group, after it published data purporting to show that X had allowed ads to run next to Nazi and Holocaust-denying posts. Some big companies, including Apple, Disney and <small>IBM,</small> pulled their advertising from the site following the report. X claims Media Matters “manipulated” data in order to destroy its business.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">Beyond satire</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">X was not the only social-media company to find itself in hot water over antisemitic-related content. A number of Jewish celebrities urged <b>TikTok</b> to tackle a rise in anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli posts on its platform, which includes the re-emergence of Osama bin Laden’s bilious rant against Jews and the West, which first surfaced in 2002. Bin Laden’s self-styled “Letter to America” recently went viral on TikTok, which eventually removed hashtags linked to it. Sacha Baron Cohen, a comedic actor, said TikTok was “creating the biggest antisemitic movement since the Nazis”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In a tough week, Mr Musk was at least able to celebrate a further advance in testing SpaceX’s <b><a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/11/22/spacex-tests-starship-and-prepares-to-face-down-amazon">Starship</a></b> rocket, the biggest ever built. After leaving its launch pad in Texas, Starship’s two stages separated successfully and one reached space for the first time, but the “super heavy booster” part of the rocket then exploded. SpaceX said this second test had provided it with invaluable data in planning for the next flight.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Broadcom</b> at last completed its $69bn takeover of <b><small>VM</small>ware</b> after Chinese regulators approved the deal.

Net profit rose to $9.2bn compared with $680m in the same period last year. The company expects sales to China will drop “significantly” because of tighter restrictions on exporting <small>AI</small> chips to the country, but thinks revenues will climb again this quarter as demand from elsewhere makes up the shortfall.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Alibaba’s</b> share price recovered some of the ground it lost when it said it would now not spin off its cloud unit. The Chinese internet giant cited America’s latest restrictions on exports of advanced chips to China as a reason for reversing course, as it believes the curbs will “materially and adversely affect” the business.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The British government unveiled its <b>“<a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/11/22/britains-chancellor-offers-tax-cuts-and-fiscal-trickery">autumn statement</a>”</b>, a kind of mini-budget. The rate of national insurance, a payroll tax that employees pay, will be cut from 12% to 10%. In another giveaway, a tax break that enables businesses to deduct investment from their taxable profits will be made permanent. The government’s ebullient presentation of its plans was at odds with the downgrading of official <small>GDP</small> forecasts.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">Bargaining power</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A new contract between the <b>United Auto Workers</b> and Ford, General Motors and Stellantis was ratified by the union’s members, bringing an official end to its strike.
