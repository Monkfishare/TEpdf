In most of the world we used the <small>COP</small> as a chance to take stock of the climate crisis. In the Middle East and Africa we focused on the United Arab Emirates, the conference’s host, as an example of how some countries can thrive in a fragmenting world.<br/><br/>Climate covers are some of the hardest to get right. The message is often both depressing and familiar—a reader-repelling combination. The message can easily be muffled under a blanket of jargon and contested scientific complexity. The fact that climate change is as important as anything we write about only increases the risk that readers see our coverage as a duty rather than a pleasure. <br/><br/>We have two ways to counter those perceptions: humour and the suggestion that we bear good news as well as bad.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In our first attempt we depicted scales suspended from the rotors of a wind turbine. These say that we are weighing up the state of the climate. It’s clever, but studiously neutral and serious-minded. What’s more, some of us thought that we’d had a lot of climate/turbine covers in recent months. Time to ring the changes.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">We tried an acid-house mash-up of emojis, one smiling and the other frowning. And the state of the climate is indeed both pitiable and surprisingly positive. At the time of the Paris <small>COP </small>in 2015, the global warming expected by 2100 if policies did not change was more than 3°C above pre-industrial levels. With today’s policies, central estimates put it around 2.5-2.9°C, though the uncertainties are large. That would still be disastrous for billions, but it is also a marked improvement.<br/><br/>One of our number was, however, thoroughly disturbed by the tragi-comic emojis. In deference, we looked for something else.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">We thought of a school report. A lot of progress has come from cheaper and more widespread renewable energy. Better policies have spread, too. In 2014 just 12% of energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions came under carbon-pricing schemes and the average price per tonne was $7; today 23% of greenhouse-gas emissions do, and the price is around $32.<br/><br/>Yet much more remains to be done. Even if <small>COP28</small> produces an agreement to plug the leakage of methane into the atmosphere, as well as on climate finance and fossil fuels, the world will have to grapple with solar geoengineering and the technologies and funding behind carbon-dioxide removal, the subject of a special series of articles in this issue. <br/><br/>We had a couple of cracks at the school report—one that looks retro enough to have been submitted by Wackford Squeers of Dotheboys Hall, and the other chaotic enough to have been submitted by a teacher who is a regular user of the tragi-comic emojis we had just rejected.<br/><br/>We opted for modernity, changed the mysterious “<small>COP</small> report” to “climate change”, sorted out the categories and grades, and embraced the chaos in the climate.</p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="1684" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231125_DE_US.jpg" srcset="../image/20231125_DE_US.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Leaders:</b> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/23/progress-on-climate-change-has-not-been-fast-enough-but-it-has-been-real">Progress on climate change has not been fast enough, but it has been real<br/></a><b>Special report:</b> <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023-11-25">Carbon-dioxide removal<br/></a><b>Science and technology:</b> <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/11/22/solar-geoengineering-is-becoming-a-respectable-idea">Solar geoengineering is becoming a respectable idea</a></p><hr class="css-11rnjw e10jdj00"/><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Our regional cover was about the <small>UAE</small>. It is a tiny place, home to just over 0.1% of the world’s people, and produces only 0.5% of global <small>GDP</small>. But it also shows how to thrive in a multipolar age.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">We began by illustrating the skyline of the city emerging from a black cloud: order emerging from chaos. Even as war rages in the Middle East and superpower rivalry unravels the world, the <small>UAE</small>’s non-oil economy is growing at nearly 6% a year, a rate that India is enjoying but that the West—and these days even China—can only dream of. Talent and wealth are flocking to the country. Last year it attracted more foreign investment for greenfield projects than anywhere except America, Britain and India. <br/><br/>Some of us liked this image, but it is very dark—and we have featured a few skylines of Gulf cities over the past months.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Instead we looked for symbols of the <small>UAE</small> and alighted on the Gulf’s august tradition of falconry. This soaring raptor gets at the <small>UAE</small>’s successes, but also at its predatory foreign policy. Even as the country plays to its economic strengths as an entrepot, a centre of green energy and artificial intelligence, all enhanced by its willingness to welcome foreign talent and openness to trade, its autocratic ruler has also backed murderous militias sowing mayhem in countries such as Libya, Yemen and, lately, Sudan.<br/><br/>That was a good option, and we could well have chosen it. However, another, more contemporary idea struck us: “Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol”—the one where Tom Cruise climbs up the Burj Khalifa with the help of a pair of gloves that borrow gecko’s-feet physics.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Here is our Emirati agent, suspended stomach-churningly above the Dubai traffic system. That captures something about a country that straddles political and economic divisions: a closed autocracy with one of the world’s most open economies; a close ally of America that has China as its biggest trading partner; a place whose <small>GDP</small> per person exceeds that of Britain or France, but it is often seen as part of the global south; an Arab country that has normalised relations with Israel. <br/><br/>In a fragmented world that’s an agile piece of climbing. But what if one of those gecko gloves should go on the blink?</p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="1684" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231125_DE_ME.jpg" srcset="../image/20231125_DE_ME.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Leaders:</b> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/23/how-to-thrive-in-a-fractured-world">How to thrive in a fractured world<br/></a><b>Briefing:</b> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/23/the-messier-the-world-gets-the-more-the-uae-seems-to-thrive">The messier the world gets, the more the <small>UAE</small> seems to thrive</a></p></div></section></body>
