Supermarkets have hired security guards to fight off shoplifters. Thousands of businesses have closed. One official reckons the current economic crisis is worse than that caused by the covid-19 lockdowns.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">About 160,000 Palestinians employed in Israel and in Jewish settlements in the West Bank have had their work permits revoked since October 7th. Tens of thousands more worked in Israel illegally. Before the war their salaries pumped some 1.4bn shekels ($370m) a month into the West Bank’s economy.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Because it does not control its own borders, the Palestinian Authority (<small>PA</small>) has to rely on Israel to collect import taxes on its behalf, which account for 64% of its total revenue. When the Gaza war broke out, Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister, refused to transfer any of this money to the <small>PA</small>, though the Israeli cabinet later compromised, saying it would withhold the portion paid by the <small>PA</small> to Gaza. Though Hamas has controlled the strip since 2007, the <small>PA</small> still covers Gaza’s power bill to Israel and pays the salaries of thousands of public workers including those in the health ministry and the official Palestinian security forces, who are paid to stay at home. In response Shoukri Bishara, the <small>PA</small>’s finance minister, furiously rejected the whole amount. Accepting it would, he says, have been a “violation of our social contract” with Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Those two factors have led to an 80% drop in the <small>PA</small>‘s revenues since October 7th, leaving Mr Bishara with a fiscal deficit of $1.5bn (roughly 10% of <small>GDP</small> in the Palestinian territories). In November it was unable to pay public servants their salaries at all, though it did manage to convince the Bank of Palestine to offer some employees loans worth half of their pay.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Whereas foreign aid once made up 30% of the <small>PA</small>’s operating budget, it paid for just 0.7% of it this year. But the Palestinian economy still relies heavily on aid. Donors have shifted much of their direct budgetary support to development financing, in part because of frustration at the <small>PA</small>’s rampant corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">That is one reason why the <small>PA</small> is in a poor position to deal with economic crises. Another is that it cannot get funds from the <small>IMF</small>, because it is not a member-state of the fund. With no central bank it has no lender of last resort to bail out its banks, some of which are starting to sweat after writing off at least $1bn in loans in Gaza. In normal times lending to <small>PA</small> employees is a tidy source of income. Yet unless they are paid their salaries soon, thousands will begin to default on their consumer debts.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Adding to the banks’ woes are signs of capital flight, especially by Palestinians with a foot in Jordan or in the Gulf. Mr Bishara has reduced the <small>PA</small>’s borrowing from Palestinian banks and is loth to increase it again because of the risks this could pose to financial stability. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">To stave off the <small>PA</small>’s financial collapse Mr Bishara could try to persuade Mr Smotrich to hand over the customs revenues. But there are few signs Israel’s finance minister will have a change of heart, even though America has tried to alert him to the security risks if the <small>PA </small>goes bust.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">America and the <small>EU</small> are particularly worried about the already meagre salaries of the more than 30,000 members of the Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Without pay these men with guns will have little incentive to keep turning up for work. Some have already stopped. “We can tell him [Mr Smotrich] his policies are risking the financial collapse of the <small>PA</small>,” says a diplomat in Jerusalem. “But for him that’s a long-coveted dream.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The <small>PA</small> has asked Qatar for $900m to get through the next six months. But so far neither Qatar nor any of the other Gulf states seems prepared to pay Israel’s obligations, says Raja Khalidi, a Palestinian economist. If they did, it might further tempt Israel to deduct the money it is meant to hand over under a protocol of the Oslo accords, the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A handout might also allow the <small>PA</small> to set aside desperately needed reforms. “Temporary mechanisms often have a terrible way of becoming permanent and ineffective,” says Mr Khalidi. It could also offer a lifeline to a sclerotic and corrupt institution that few Palestinians believe can ever bring about a Palestinian state. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">America has been touting the idea of a “revitalised <small>PA</small>” as the only serious alternative to Hamas’s rule in Gaza. Yet if the pressure of the economic war being waged against the <small>PA</small> by Israel’s far-right government is not relieved soon, there may be little left of the <small>PA </small>to run the West Bank, let alone to govern Gaza. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body>
