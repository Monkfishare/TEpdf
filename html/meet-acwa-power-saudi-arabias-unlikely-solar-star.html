Muhammad bin Salman, its crown prince and de facto ruler, would like this to change. He wants half of Saudi electricity to come from wind and solar farms by 2030. Two-thirds of that capacity, or around 40 gigawatts (<small>GW</small>) will, if Prince Muhammad gets his wish (as he tends to do), be courtesy of one firm: <small>ACWA</small> Power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For most of its 19-year existence the utility was a relatively anonymous family-run affair. No longer. Since it went public in Riyadh in 2021 its market value has swelled nearly four-fold. It is now worth $50bn. The Public Investment Fund (<small>PIF</small>), the steward of Saudi sovereign wealth, owns a 44% stake. <small>ACWA</small> has 24<small>GW</small> of green projects at home and abroad either already running or at an advanced stage, up from 0.3<small>GW</small> in 2014. Add its other capacity under construction and the total is 54<small>GW</small>. Its original business of desalinating water went from 1m cubic metres a day in 2006 to 7.6m cubic metres in December. Its newish boss, Marco Arcelli, a seasoned Italian energy executive, expects assets it has a stake in to triple between now and 2030, to $250bn. Its projects will, he hopes, help create a broader domestic green-energy supply chain. “We are a big enabler,” he says.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>ACWA</small> has thrived as many other renewables operators around the world have struggled. Whereas those rivals are seeing the cost of projects soar as a result of rising interest rates, <small>ACWA</small> has received non-interest-bearing loans from the <small>PIF</small>, in addition to debt secured against individual projects and loans from banks to tide it over while it raises more equity capital and brings in partners. Access to easy money has allowed <small>ACWA</small> to expand capacity, while lowering costs for customers. This has helped make the levelised cost of Saudi solar energy, which takes into account both construction and operation of a power plant, among the lowest in the world.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Nevertheless, <small>ACWA</small>’s returns on domestic projects are low by global standards. Mr Arcelli is thus keen to take advantage of juicier ones on offer abroad. He is investing nearby (in Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Oman, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates) and farther afield (Azerbaijan, Morocco, South Africa and Uzbekistan). Two-fifths of <small>ACWA</small>’s overall capacity is to be found outside Saudi Arabia. It is also eyeing China, a highly competitive market but one where <small>ACWA</small> could, thinks Mr Arcelli, gain both scale and technology partners in the form of Chinese manufacturers of wind turbines and solar panels.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>ACWA</small> has its work cut out. To meet Prince Muhammad’s domestic goals for it, the company must add 6-7<small>GW</small> of capacity—equivalent to three or four big projects—every year for the rest of the decade. It currently has just 14<small>GW</small> at various stages of development. Managing fast expansion will require a laser focus on costs (those of its nascent hydrogen venture has already risen by 70% from initial estimates, to $8bn). It will also require more debt. In September <small>ACWA</small> was already sitting on $7bn of it, equivalent to seven times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. Such a ratio would be considered a red flag at most firms.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>ACWA</small> may yet rise to the challenge. It can count on the <small>PIF</small>’s deep pockets. And it is a fast learner; its domestic 1.5<small>GW</small> Sudair solar project may be fully up and running in just over two years, reckons Oliver Connor of Citigroup, a bank, brisk by industry standards. Mr Arcelli wants things to go faster still. Given that the prince is watching, that is no surprise. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><i>For more coverage of climate change, sign up for <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters">The Climate Issue</a>, our fortnightly subscriber-only newsletter, or visit our <a href="https://www.economist.com/climate-change">climate-change hub</a>.</i></p></div></section></body>
