As you pointed out, the temptation to use secondary legislation has proved irresistible to governments of all colours. The fact that such legislation can only be approved or rejected and cannot be amended has meant that both houses of Parliament, and particularly the Lords, have been reluctant to press the “reject” button. Indeed, on the last occasion the Lords did so, in 2015 over tax-credit cuts, a full-scale constitutional crisis resulted.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">How to redress this? One way would be to create some form of triaging process that would enable scrutiny by both houses to be focused on those regulations where it was really needed. The present procedure is more than adequate for probably more than 90% of the 700 or so pieces of secondary legislation brought forward in a normal parliamentary session. This would refute the likely argument by the government that any change to the scrutiny arrangements would gum up the whole machinery of government.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A new procedure requiring proper debate and containing a power to amend could then be introduced for the remaining regulations. This would give some teeth back to the legislature. A number of us in the Lords have made practical suggestions as to how this might work. But it will only happen if backbench <small>MP</small>s are prepared to pick up the ball and run with it. Any other approach will result in the government of the day alleging that this is the unelected Lords telling the elected Commons how to do its job better. That would be game over.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Robin Hodgson<br/></small>Chairman<br/>Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee, 2019-23<br/>House of Lords<i><br/>London</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The decline in parliamentary scrutiny is not just an unfortunate accident. For good or ill, with a largely unwritten constitution, the British Parliament is dominated by precedent. The legislative short cuts so enthusiastically employed by the present government to avoid scrutiny for Brexit and covid will be quoted as legitimate by future administrations with even less justification. As you indicated, this forms part of a pattern, a consistent and remorseless shift of power to the executive. In our recently published analysis “Can Parliament Take Back Control?”, we reprint Lord Hailsham’s <small>BBC</small> lecture in 1976 on “Elective Dictatorship”. Is this where we are heading?</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Paul Tyler<br/></small>Former Liberal Democrat spokesperson for political and constitutional reform<i><br/>Stroud, Gloucestershire</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">One possible, but tendentious, proposal to resolve this terrible state of affairs would be a reform of the House of Commons, reducing the current number of constituencies and, therefore <small>MP</small>s, from 650 to around 300. Counterintuitive as this might sound, it would force a change to the whole content of an <small>MP</small>’s working day. He or she would need to focus on their main task of passing quality legislation and less time on the local affairs of their much bigger constituencies. To achieve the former they would need a much larger expert staff working with them to review bills properly. This would be made affordable by the huge reduction in the number of <small>MP</small>s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The vacuum in constituency work could be filled by devolving much more power to existing locally elected councillors, who would, in any case, be more up to scratch with local affairs and take informed decisions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Without a radical reform of our constitution in some way similar to this, there is little hope of any tangible improvement in the future.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Alan Cross<br/></small><i>London</i></p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Trump pointing with his right arm in the air" data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231104_LDD003.jpg" srcset="../image/20231104_LDD003.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Anthony Gerace</span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">Limited trade protections</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">You agree that tariffs can help some manufacturers gain domestic market share (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/02/donald-trumps-tariff-plans-would-inflict-grievous-damage-on-america-and-the-world" target="_blank">Trade wars: episode II</a>”, November 4th). But you stress that this benefit comes at the cost of sheltered manufacturers getting away with being less efficient than their global rivals, and imposing costs on other domestic industries that use their more expensive products.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Protection can be arranged so as to give a higher benefit-cost ratio than you imply. In South Korea and Taiwan, new producers in strategic industries were given protection on their domestic market sales, and accrued higher profits. They were required to use the higher profits to subsidise entry into export markets. They were given a time limit to reach international levels of price and quality, after which the protection would be removed. Whether this could be implemented in the United States is questionable; but it should be considered in many industrialising countries.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Robert Wade<br/></small>Professor of global political economy<br/>London School of Economics</p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231104_LDD001.jpg" srcset="../image/20231104_LDD001.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Andrea Ucini</span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">A useful monetary tool</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The claim that the world economy is defying gravity and will surely hit the rocks as higher interest rates bite downplays the considerable benefits that come from those higher rates (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/02/the-world-economy-is-defying-gravity-that-cannot-last" target="_blank">Too good to be true</a>”, November 4th). Most obviously, higher rates are a signal that the spectre of deflation that haunted the world economy for over a decade after the financial crisis of 2007-09, leading to ultra-low rates, has been banished. Zero or even negative interest rates caused serious distortions in the financial system and engendered a sense of malaise and economic permacrisis.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The disappearance of low rates is a signal to consumers, at least, that things are “back to normal”. And, as you note, central banks will eventually cut rates again. This is the biggest benefit of all. Central banks have regained the ability to boost the economy by cutting interest rates, and quantitative easing can be consigned to history.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Bill Smyth<br/></small><i>Bagshot, Surrey</i></p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231111_LDP002.jpg" srcset="../image/20231111_LDP002.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Alamy</span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">The reality of realtors</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Thank you for telling Americans how realtors rip them off (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/08/time-to-take-a-wrecking-ball-to-realtors-fees-in-america" target="_blank">The great realtor racket</a>”, November 11th). My wife and I have been “rippees” numerous times during our 80-plus year lifetimes. It takes no more time and effort to sell a $500,000 home than a $1m one, but the land sharks scoop up a commission that is doubled.
