That is doubly true when they take place in prisons. In August 1993 a game in a São Paulo jail ended in horrific fashion. Eight inmates attacked their opponents, killing at least two. Covered in blood, they proclaimed the birth of a new gang: the First Capital Command (<small>PCC</small>). Thirty years later the <small>PCC</small> is Latin America’s biggest gang, with estimates suggesting it has 40,000 lifetime members and another 60,000 “contractors”. That would make it one of the world’s largest crime groups. And on November 6th a leaked report by Portugal’s security services claimed the group has 1,000 associates in Lisbon, the capital. The <small>PCC</small> is going global.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The gang’s network of allies began in South America. A decade ago the<small> PCC</small> formed an association with some of the world’s biggest cocaine-traffickers. Based in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz, this “super gang” is dedicated to joint ventures in drugs and money-laundering. Local media thought it sounded like Mercosur, the regional trading bloc. They named it “Narcosur”. The <small>PCC</small> has separate relationships with Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua, a human-trafficking group, too.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="626" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20231125_AMC522.png" srcset="../image/20231125_AMC522.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But in recent years, the <small>PCC</small> has concentrated on building ties with Europe. In 2021 a record 303 tonnes of blow were seized in the European Union (see chart). The farther it is shipped, the bigger the margins. Previously the <small>PCC</small> bought coke wholesale in Bolivia for $1,500 per kilogram, got it onto a ship in a Brazilian port, and sold it on for $8,000 per kilogram. By setting up a base in Europe, members can sell that kilogram for over $30,000.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Members of the <small>PCC</small> are thought to be present in half a dozen European countries, including Britain. The gang runs over 50% of Brazil’s drug exports to the continent, says Lincoln Gakiya, an organised-crime prosecutor from São Paulo. It mostly works with Italy’s ‘Ndrangheta, Europe’s biggest mafia. The two syndicates have partnered for years. ‘Ndrangheta brokers are regularly arrested in Brazil, where they make hefty deals. In May an investigation by Europol, the <small>EU</small>’s police agency, revealed that the ‘Ndrangheta was shipping the <small>PCC</small> guns from Pakistan. It collaborates with Albanian and Serbian drug gangs, too.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Another area the gang is expanding in is west Africa, a major transit zone for the white stuff. The <small>PCC</small> has become a central player pumping drugs through the region, according to a recent report by the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime, a Swiss-based think-tank. It is also probably behind a reverse route, where Moroccan cannabis is smuggled to Brazil.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">According to Christian Azevedo, of Brazil’s federal police, in Nigeria <small>PCC</small> gangsters brazenly walk the streets of Lagos and Abuja. “They even control neighbourhoods there, the same way they do in São Paulo,” he says, citing intelligence from his Nigerian counterparts. The Nigerian connection has helped the gang push into southern Africa, too. South Africa is a key point for sending coke to emerging markets in India and China.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Criminal clout is not merely about powerful friends or geographic range. Territorial and social control are important as well. The <small>PCC</small> is no slouch there. “They exert a type of control that no other group has ever exerted, except Colombia’s <small>FARC</small> at their apex,” says Steven Dudley of InSight Crime, an investigative outlet. The gang is a parallel state in Brazil’s <i>favelas</i>, governing the lives of tens of millions. In the 2000s it even ordered a reduction in urban violence, converting São Paulo from one of Brazil’s most dangerous cities to one of its safest. Even so, if its interests are threatened the group will employ extreme violence, notes Mr Gakiya. In 2019 he ordered the transfer of 22 <small>PCC</small> leaders to maximum-security jails. As a result, the gang put him on a kill list. He now lives under police protection. When being interviewed, he warned that the call might drop out: his armoured doors interrupt the signal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The final stage of a transition into a global mafia is the penetration of politics and the legal economy. The <small>PCC</small> is starting to do that, thinks Mr Gakiya. The attorney-general’s office in the state of São Paulo has investigated mayors and councillors. It found <small>PCC</small> involvement in everything from rubbish disposal and public transport to construction projects and hotels. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body>
