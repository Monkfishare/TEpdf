The demonstration brought together leaders from across the political spectrum, except the hard left, which boycotted the event. Similar marches took place in other French cities.

Lord Cameron led the country from 2010 to 2016, resigning after losing the fateful Brexit referendum. Because he sits in the House of Lords he cannot answer questions from <small>MP</small>s in the House of Commons. Some of those <small>MP</small>s have raised concerns about Lord Cameron’s past cosiness with China.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">As Lord Cameron was appointed foreign secretary, his predecessor, James Cleverly, was moved to the home office to replace <b>Suella Braverman</b>, who was sacked. Ms Braverman had become a thorn in Mr Sunak’s side, most recently for her outspoken opposition to what she describes as “hate marches” in London in support of Palestine.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>MP</small>s in Parliament easily defeated a motion calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.

Mr Sánchez has forged a left-wing coalition to stay in power after an inconclusive election in July in which his Socialist party came second to the conservative People’s Party. The <small>PP</small> failed to form its own coalition, but wanted a new election, rather than “a dictatorship through the back door”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, admitted that the <small>EU’</small>s goal of providing <b>Ukraine</b> with 1m artillery shells by March next year will not be met. The commitment has been bogged down by bureaucracy and delays as <small>EU</small> countries pool their ammunition, rather than pledge the shells individually. Russia has sometimes fired up to 30,000 shells a day in the war; Ukraine launches about a quarter of that number.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Finland’s</b> prime minister accused <b>Russia</b> of channelling migrants over their border.
