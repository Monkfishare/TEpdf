Evidence of that came on December 4th when the <small>US</small> Justice Department charged Victor Manuel Rocha, a former American ambassador, with secretly serving as a Cuban agent for 42 years.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Rocha would be one of the highest-placed moles that America’s government has recently found. An indictment says that he started working for Cuba no later than in 1981 and joined the State Department that year. He went on to become the top official for the Americas in the National Security Council in the White House, a senior diplomat in Havana, deputy ambassador in Argentina and ambassador in Bolivia between 1999 and 2002.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Even after retirement, Mr Rocha had access to valuable intelligence. From 2006 to 2012 he was an adviser to the head of the Pentagon’s Southern Command, which has responsibility for Latin America. He was in contact with the <small>DGI</small> as recently as 2016 or 2017. He was caught in a sting when the <small>FBI</small> pretended to be his new handler. He is said to have praised Fidel Castro, Cuba’s revolutionary leader, as “the <i>Comandante</i>”, referred to the United States as “the enemy” and described Cuban spooks as <i>compañeros</i>, or comrades. “What we have done”, he is said to have boasted, is “enormous …more than a grand slam.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Rocha is not the first such case. “I don’t find this particularly surprising,” says Duyane Norman, who ran the <small>CIA</small>’s Latin American operations. “Pound for pound Cuba is recognised as one of the better intelligence services in the world.” Cuban intelligence was modelled on the Soviet <small>KGB</small> and East German Stasi. It penetrated the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on the recruitment of women and Hispanic men. In 1987 Florentino Aspillaga Lombard, a top Cuban intelligence officer, defected and revealed that virtually every <small>CIA</small> agent on the island since the 1960s had been plants, or later turned and fed misinformation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">American spooks have long acknowledged that their Cuban counterparts were part of, as one government report noted, “a first-rate intelligence service” who could run “highly aggressive operations…throughout the world”. One reason for this was that, as in other communist countries, the brightest often gravitate to positions that bring power and privilege, such as the opportunity to live abroad, says Mr Norman. “They have been cultivating a class of genuine professional intelligence officers for a long time,” he adds.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Those officers have taken a long-term view. “One of the hallmarks of a lot of Cuban operations is patience,” says Mr Norman, allowing recruits to rise to positions of prominence over time. He points to the example of the “Cuban Five”, a group of intelligence officers arrested in Miami in 1998 and accused of infiltrating anti-Castro groups. Mr Rocha was recruited at around aged 30 and helped by the <small>DGI</small> to join the State Department.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Cuba’s biggest known success was Ana Montes, the top Cuba analyst in the Pentagon’s Defence Intelligence Agency (<small>DIA</small>). She had been recruited by Cuban intelligence in 1984, trained in Havana and served as an agent for 17 years until her arrest in 2001. In that time she revealed the names of four American undercover officers in Cuba and details of operations in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The case of Ms Montes, who was released from prison in January, illustrates another reason why the <small>DGI </small>has enjoyed such success. Cuba does not need to resort to what Russia calls <i>kompromat</i>,<i> </i>compromising material to blackmail would-be agents, says Mr Norman. Ideology is often enough. Just as Soviet spies traded on the appeal of anti-fascism and socialism in the 1930s, so too did the <small>DGI</small> exploit the (former) romance of the Cuban revolution.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In the cold war the <small>KGB</small> had to pay, often handsomely, to recruit many of its best agents. Mr Rocha and Ms Montes apparently worked for free. Ms Montes was radicalised by the Reagan administration’s policy in Latin America, including its intervention in Grenada in 1983 and its support for the Contras, right-wing rebels, in Nicaragua. She was, she later told the <small>FBI</small>, a “comrade in the struggle” against America. Mr Rocha, though adopting right-wing garb—last year he contributed to the re-election effort of an anti-Castro congresswoman—was driven by the same ideology. He boasted that his “number-one priority” was to prevent any action “that would endanger…the revolution itself.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body>
