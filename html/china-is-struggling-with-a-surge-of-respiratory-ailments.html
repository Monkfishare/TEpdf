On November 29th a provincial newspaper posted a message on Weibo, a microblog service, describing an unnamed hospital in the north. The waiting area, it said, was filled with the sound of coughing and the crying of children. After receiving confirmation that her daughter had tested positive for a bacterium that can cause pneumonia, one woman, having waited hours, still had 300 people ahead of her in the queue for a consultation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The item rapidly became one of Weibo’s hottest-trending posts: its hashtag received tens of millions of views. It was quickly deleted. China’s censors apparently want to keep the temperature down. But in recent days similar stories have filled the internet. Some have included pictures of packed fever clinics and even of children doing their homework while hooked to intravenous drips. The covid-era custom of wearing masks in public had all but ended in China. Amid a recent surge of respiratory diseases, especially among children, it is making a comeback.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">On November 22nd the World Health Organisation (<small>WHO</small>) asked China for more details of the outbreaks, raising concerns all over. On the following day Chinese officials told the <small>WHO</small> that there was no new or unknown cause of these ailments. They said the infections were being caused by a range of familiar pathogens, such as the <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> bacterium, as well as adenovirus, covid-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus, or <small>RSV</small>. The <small>WHO</small> said some of the increases were “earlier in the season than historically experienced, but not unexpected” given the lifting of covid controls, and were similar to patterns observed in other countries. It quoted the Chinese officials as saying that hospitals were not being overwhelmed.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">Drips all around</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But it is clear that China’s health-care system still suffers from problems that make it prone to unusual stress. One is the weakness of primary health care. The number of general practitioners (<small>GP</small>s) has more than quadrupled since 2012, but there are still far fewer of them per person than there are in rich countries and they are often poorly trained. Many Chinese prefer to go straight to hospitals for diagnosis and treatment rather than consult a <small>GP</small>. This causes lengthy queues, especially at the best facilities. Another handicap is pressure on doctors to generate revenue. Ill-informed patients demand unnecessary treatments, which doctors are often willing to prescribe (such as intravenous infusions even for minor ailments).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">China has stopped publishing regular statistics on covid vaccinations, but last year take-up was low among the elderly. Less than 4% of over-60s typically get a flu jab. So it will be a tough winter for China’s hospitals—and for the country’s most vulnerable people. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><i>Subscribers can sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/drum-tower" target="_blank">Drum Tower</a>, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China—and what China makes of the world.</i></p></div></section></body>
