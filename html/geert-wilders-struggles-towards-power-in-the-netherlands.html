In his newspaper column last week, Ronald Plasterk, a former Labour minister who has turned right, said a government of the <small>PVV</small> and three less radical parties should be simple. It is not, as Mr Plasterk is discovering. The <small>PVV</small> picked him as the <i>verkenner</i>, who sounds out the parties, after its first choice quit over a corruption scandal. It turns out that forming a government including Mr Wilders, long shunned by other parties, is far from easy.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="626" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20231202_EUC563.png" srcset="../image/20231202_EUC563.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Wilders’s preferred partners are the centre-right Liberals (<small>VVD</small>), whom he has been lambasting for the 13 years they have been in power. But Dilan Yesilgoz, the <small>VVD</small>’s new leader, says it will not join the cabinet; after losing ten seats it should leave government for a while. She would, though, back a right-wing government in a confidence-and-supply deal. A smaller party, the populist Farmer Citizen Movement (<small>BBB</small>), is keener to join.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But one party Mr Wilders needs is not on board. New Social Contract (<small>NSC</small>) is a brand-new outfit set up by Pieter Omtzigt, a former Christian Democrat and a stickler for the rule of law. During the campaign he ruled out a coalition with the <small>PVV</small>, whose plans for banning mosques and so on violate the constitution. Mr Wilders says he will park those, but that is not enough for Mr Omtzigt. He refuses to negotiate with the <small>PVV</small> unless it scraps the unconstitutional bits of its manifesto and promises to stay in the <small>EU</small>, honour treaties, aid Ukraine and fight climate change.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Even if Mr Wilders can satisfy Mr Omtzigt, a minority government without the <small>VVD </small>would need ministers from the untested <small>PVV</small>, <small>NSC</small> and <small>BBB,</small> which would struggle to find good ones—as the corruption scandal showed. In the Netherlands <small>MP</small>s must quit parliament to become ministers, which the <small>PVV</small> can ill afford: it could barely fill the seats it won (the new <small>MP</small>s include a metalworker and a pancake-kiosk owner). Such a government would lack a majority in the Senate, which can veto legislation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Leftists staged protest marches against Mr Wilders’s win, but uncertainty over a coalition has muted their reaction. Some like the <small>PVV</small>’s economic agenda, which makes vague promises of more housing and cheaper health care. Many Dutch Muslims count on the constitution and a strong judiciary to protect them. Such complacency is risky: as Poland, Hungary and America show, populists relish battles with the courts. “We should not just assume that the universal populist playbook does not apply in the Netherlands,” says John Morijn, a rule-of-law expert at the University of Groningen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Ms Yesilgoz’s vow not to join a government may be just “a typical negotiating tactic”, says Kay van de Linde, a political analyst. “She’s hoping Wilders will beg her.” Mr Wilders could let another party provide the prime minister; all four parties want a tougher line on migration. He may yet give the Dutch their most right-wing government ever. But it now looks less likely: the Muslim-bashing, Eurosceptic populist would have to change his stripes. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body>
