In January 2019 the office-sharing company was valued at $47bn; it is now worth roughly 0.1% of that. The petition is limited to the firm’s locations in America and Canada, and its franchisees will continue to operate.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">American employers created 150,000 <b>jobs</b> in October, fewer than the market had expected and barely half the number for the previous month. Despite hawkish talk from officials at the <b>Federal Reserve</b> and other central banks, investors took that as a signal that interest rates may fall sooner than they had previously thought.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="598" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20231111_WWC386.png" srcset="../image/20231111_WWC386.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Lower interest-rate expectations led <b>bond yields</b> to fall. That was true not just in America, where the ten-year Treasury yield recently touched 5% and is now 4.5%, but also in Britain, Japan and much of Europe. After a miserable few months, <b>American shares</b> ended their losing streak and surged, with the benchmark <small>S</small>&amp;<small>P</small> 500 index posting its best week since November 2022.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The <small>IMF</small> raised its forecasts for <b>China’s <small>GDP</small> growth</b> to 5.4% in 2023 and 4.6% in 2024, up from 5% and 4.2% respectively.  The fund cited unexpectedly good third-quarter growth and government stimulus.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Nevertheless, China’s economy faces a multitude of threats. Falling <b>pork prices</b>, which weigh heavily on its consumer-price index, have pushed the economy back into <b>deflation</b>. And not all the government’s actions are supportive. Reports suggest it has <b>detained </b>two more businessmen: Zhao Bingxian, a prominent investor, and Chen Shaojie, a tech founder.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">Back on the market</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Turkey</b> borrowed $2.5bn on the dollar bond market, in its first such deal since April. Investors are more inclined to lend to a government that has shaken up its economic team and begun to ditch unorthodox policies, such as keeping interest rates low despite extreme inflation. The five-year “sukuk” bond was sold with a yield of 8.5%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Carlyle</b>, a private-equity giant, reported a disappointing set of results for the third quarter. Investors have committed less capital than it had hoped to its new buy-out funds. In the three months to September they attracted $6.3bn of new assets, an 11% decline from the previous quarter. The firm is shedding jobs and has warned staff that “every single expense is on the table.”</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b><small>KKR</small></b>, a competitor of Carlyle, was much more upbeat. It reported an improvement in fundraising during the third quarter, to more than $14bn, and announced the launch of new buy-out funds in America and Asia. <small>KKR</small>’s share price finished results day 5% higher than it started.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Going by its share price, <b><small>UBS</small></b> also recorded good results, despite reporting its first quarterly loss since 2017. Investors were in a forgiving mood because the loss derived from the costs of integrating <b>Credit Suisse</b>, another Swiss bank that <small>UBS</small> bought earlier this year. (Without these, the bank would have made a pre-tax profit of $844m.) The deal is nonetheless likely to provide a big fillip to <small>UBS</small>’s wealth-management business in the long run. Its investment-banking division, meanwhile, joined many of its European peers in reporting a disappointing quarter. It lost $230m.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Saudi Aramco</b> followed several other big oil companies by reporting bumper earnings. It made $32.6bn in net profit in the three months to September, exceeding analysts’ forecasts.  That was more than it made in the previous quarter, but 23% less than in the third quarter of 2022, after energy prices rocketed in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Saudi Arabia, like other <small>OPEC</small> countries, is currently cutting crude-oil production in an attempt to boost its price.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/09/the-bob-iger-v-nelson-peltz-rematch">Disney</a> </b>announced that it will cut a further $2bn from its annual expenses, having already committed to $5.5bn of cuts and 8,000 job losses earlier this year. Under pressure from Nelson Peltz, an activist investor, it expects to start paying a dividend by the end of 2023 for the first time in years, and for its streaming business to become profitable in the second half of 2024.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">Give me warp speed, Mr Sulu</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For only the second time since it was founded in 2009, <b>Uber </b>made an operating profit, of $394m. In the same quarter last year, the ride-hailing company made a loss of $495m. Since then, the average number of trips customers have booked per day has risen by 25%, to 27m, and the firm’s revenue has grown by 11%, to $9.3bn. Uber’s share price has doubled since the start of 2023.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>SAG</small>-<small>AFTRA</small>, the <b>Hollywood actors’ union</b>, voted to end its 118-day strike after agreeing on a tentative deal with producers. Together with another strike, by screenwriters, the shutdown has delayed the release of major films such as “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty”, “Dune: Part Two” and “Paddington in Peru”.</p></div></section></body>
