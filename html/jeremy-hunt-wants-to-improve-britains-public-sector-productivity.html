The problem is especially chronic in public services (see chart), where productivity grew by just 0.2% a year on average between 1997 and 2019, according to new data released by the Office for National Statistics (<small>ONS</small>).</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="626" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20231125_BRC481.png" srcset="../image/20231125_BRC481.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">There are plenty of reasons to expect productivity growth to be weaker in the public sector than in what the <small>ONS</small> calls the “market” sector (broadly, the private sector). The activities that the state engages in are disproportionately labour-intensive. Private firms always have the option to quit low-productivity lines of business; the state cannot decide that it is getting out of, say, criminal justice. That leaves the public sector particularly exposed to “Baumol’s cost disease”, a phenomenon first identified by William Baumol, an American economist, in the 1960s. The need to recruit and retain staff who have the option to work in more productive, better-paid industries causes wages to rise by more than underlying productivity, pushing up costs.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, has made it a priority to improve this grim record.  A review of the problem was announced in June; it featured again in the <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/11/22/britains-chancellor-offers-tax-cuts-and-an-ugly-future-for-public-services">autumn statement</a> on November 22nd. For Mr Hunt, improving public-sector productivity is not only a worthwhile aim in itself but also offers a way to square the circle of weak public finances, Britons’ dissatisfaction with public services and the desire for pre-election tax cuts. Improving productivity tends to be a slow process, however. The standard solutions focus on <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/01/31/for-britain-to-grow-faster-it-needs-better-managers">improving management quality</a> or increasing the stock of capital available to each worker. That takes time, and money upfront.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">One particular affliction of the public sector since 2010 has been a shortage of administrators. With budgets squeezed by a decade of tight spending, the onus has been on cutting back-office staff and protecting services. This has in turn led to supposedly front-line staff spending ever more time on form-filling. A government report found that some public servants are spending up to one day a week on admin.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The government is hoping that better technology can fill the gap left by fewer support staff. A review of police productivity, released on November 20th, claimed that a combination of new technology and reduced bureaucracy could free up over 38m policing hours per year. The government reckons that it can cut the admin burden on teachers by five hours a week over the next three years. But excited talk about artificial intelligence jostles with the reality of glitching government <small>IT</small> systems; many public-sector workers are sceptical that better tech can substitute for people.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">There is one area where changes can be made quickly. Home-working has taken a firmer hold in the civil service, where over a third of staff have a hybrid workweek, than in private-sector firms, where the proportion is more like a quarter. Treasury officials reckon that these public servants typically spend more days at home each week than hybrid workers in the private sector. Although research suggests that <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/12/01/the-open-questions-of-hybrid-working">hybrid work</a> does not generally dent productivity, it may hurt performance in jobs with lots of face-to-face work or with high turnover. The government may push civil servants to be in the office more often. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Even so, don’t expect surging efficiency. Improving the productivity of the public services is a vital task. Like most such tasks it is not conducive to easy fixes.<span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><i>Read more of our articles on <a href="https://www.economist.com/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a></i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/blighty">sign up</a> to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section></body>
