That means that if one comes to rely on solar geoengineering to prevent a dangerous level of warming, one is committing humanity to maintaining the deployment flawlessly over untold future generations, lest a cessation in the process leads to a catastrophic rapid warming. And if deployment is used as an excuse to continue emitting carbon, which is a probable consequence of human nature, each year would require a greater degree of solar geoengineering, incurring an ever-increasing magnitude of potential termination shock.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Some proponents say that sucking carbon out of the air will save us from a dangerous millennial commitment, but to rely on such technology to provide an exit strategy before it exists at anything like the required scale is the height of foolishness.

It is not burdensome to adopt. It works the same way as accounting for supply-chain financial costs and requires no special software or retraining of staff. When this auditable system becomes the accepted global standard for carbon declaration, investors and decision-makers will have the actual data that Mr Carney identifies as the critical first step to enable action and investment.

Previous attempts to make Britain’s finances focus on the long-term have all been, at best, only partly successful. Five-yearly spending reviews happen more than once every five years; the budget’s welfare cap was breached, then fiddled with, then redesigned; “fixed” departmental budgets are raided to pay for other priorities (the former Department for International Development being the most high-profile example).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The Treasury is simply too powerful, and has proved that it cannot be trusted to tie its own hands. Both Labour and the government would do well to accept the recommendation of Lord Maude in his recent review of the civil service and separate the budget functions of the Treasury into a separate department, as has happened in America, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The Treasury’s overbearing power is only one manifestation of the hyper-centralisation that afflicts the British state. Britain’s economic fundamentals are no worse than its European peers, yet from regional transport to housebuilding, it performs poorly. Grappling with these problems requires ending the entrenched centralisation of British decision-making and fiscal power.

Meetings are a chance for great minds to commiserate about the drudgery of their everyday lives. They are an opportunity to coalesce into a greater whole. And they give co-workers a chance to share a smile and find that maybe, just maybe, they have something in common. Instead of thought leaders haranguing us to “start on time and finish on time”, why not remind your readers that meetings are an opportunity to bring work and life together, to turn that tiresome nine-to-five into something more.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Chris Ryan<br/></small>Insurance defence counsel<i><br/>Calgary, Canada</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">I have greatly enjoyed the podcast series “<a href="https://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/boss-class" target="_blank">Boss Class</a>” by the Bartleby columnist.

It highlighted Shopify’s approach, and noted that the company’s mass deletion of recurring emails at the start of this year resulted in a reported 14% drop in meetings and a bump in productivity. However, in May Shopify cut its workforce by 20% and offloaded its logistics arm. Fewer workers should translate into fewer gatherings.
