The Eurosceptic left hoped that junking the <small>EU</small>’s state-aid rulebook would allow the government to back favoured industries. Things are not going the Thatcherites’ way.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Brexit has coincided with a dramatic rise in the use of government aid to businesses, according to a new analysis commissioned by <i>The Economist</i> from Shearman &amp; Sterling, a law firm. In 2015 British government aid amounted to 0.35% of <small>GDP</small>, compared with an <small>EU</small>-wide average of 0.67%. That surged to 2.71% in Britain and 2.39% in the <small>EU</small> in 2020, as covid-19 prompted bail-outs of stricken firms.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="626" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20231202_BRC550.png" srcset="../image/20231202_BRC550.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Spending has since fallen but to a much higher level than the pre-covid trend, at 1.19% of <small>GDP</small> in 2021 and 1.13% of <small>GDP</small> in 2022 (see chart). “We only have a few years’ data, but it appears that both the <small>EU</small> and Britain have seen significant increases in subsidisation that the pandemic alone does not explain,” says James Webber, a state-aid lawyer at Shearman &amp; Sterling.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Events have somewhat forced the government’s hand. Covid-19 was already spreading when Boris Johnson celebrated Britain’s formal exit from the <small>EU</small> in January 2020. The invasion of Ukraine in 2022 required action to mitigate energy shortages in Europe. Subsidies are in vogue everywhere; promises by politicians in Europe and America to attract manufacturing jobs and reduce dependence on China exert pressure for a response from Britain.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Working out how much the government is spending is harder than it should be. Britain no longer features in the <small>EU</small>’s annual subsidy “scoreboard” and does not produce stats on its own use of state aid. Shearman &amp; Sterling’s analysis is derived from an online government database of subsidy awards, which is clunky and lacks contextual information.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A couple of big-ticket items drove up Britain’s spending in 2021 and 2022. They include £22bn ($28bn) to capitalise the <small>UK</small> Infrastructure Bank, a new state-owned development bank intended to replicate the role of the European Investment Bank. The state also spent £3bn to bail out Bulb, a failed energy company.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">More interventionism is likely, whatever the result of the next election. The Labour Party has promised to emulate <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/09/13/joe-bidens-industrial-policy-is-big-bold-and-fraught-with-difficulty">President Joe Biden’s industrial policy</a>. It initially sketched out annual handouts for factories, steel mills and renewable energy firms of £28bn a year (1.2% of <small>GDP</small>), although the grim state of the public finances has caused it to trim its ambitions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The Tories may decry subsidy races in principle. In practice they have been ready to dole out cash to keep <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/11/27/nissans-investment-will-not-restore-britains-car-industry-to-glory">carmakers</a> and steel plants in Britain. On November 22nd the Treasury announced that it would earmark £4.5bn over five years for advanced manufacturers. Indeed Britain’s post-Brexit system is designed to be permissive. In the <small>EU</small> the commission must vet the largest subsidies before they are given. In Britain the regulator’s advice to the government is non-binding; cash awards can be clawed back only after the fact by a court. Historically Britain was a frugal user of state aid. It is becoming more European. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/blighty">sign up</a> to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><i>For more coverage of matters relating to Brexit, <a href="https://www.economist.com/brexit">visit our Brexit hub</a></i></p></div></section></body>
