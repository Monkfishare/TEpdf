Your argument in “<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/02/why-israel-must-fight-on" target="_blank">Why Israel must fight on</a>” (November 4th) that an international coalition of Western and Arab countries is needed to govern Gaza is idealistic. Western and Arab countries do not have the will to occupy Gaza. You also call for fair elections in the West Bank, hoping for “moderate” leaders to emerge with a “democratic mandate”. According to the best available polling data, Hamas would win a fair election, a disastrous result. Lastly, you believe Israel should follow international law to sustain broad support over months of fighting. But regardless of how Israel fights, it will not enjoy broad support.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Hamas is a political movement and cannot be destroyed with force alone. Either there will be a long, arduous, Israeli-led occupation of Gaza or Islamist militants will return to power there. Neither option is remotely appealing. It would be better if <i>The Economist</i> provided a sober analysis of that more realistic scenario.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Steven Baranko<br/></small><i>South Bend, Indiana</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The polarised, zero-sum way in which governments and media on both sides are depicting this conflict is frustrating. The debate is increasingly being monopolised by radicals; criticism of one side implies a defence of the other. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">There should be no debate about the atrocities and acts of terrorism committed by Hamas on October 7th. They were heinous. Trying to justify those atrocities with references to the wider conflict is akin to justifying rape by pointing to what the victim was wearing. You do not need to understand the wider context. Stating that Hamas’s atrocities were wrong does not make one anti-Palestinian. However, the manner in which the Israeli government is waging war is also wrong, and stating this does not make one anti-Israeli. Of course Israel has the right to defend itself and act, but this does not justify the tremendous loss of innocent civilian life.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Hamas has acted monstrously and <i>The Economist</i> has correctly called it so. The Israeli government is also acting monstrously, and this newspaper should have the courage to denounce it and call for different tactics.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Gabriel Sanchiz Garin<br/></small><i>London</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Far from seeking to strengthen Hamas, as you allege, Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, hit Hamas hard in three large-scale military operations in 2012, 2014 and 2021. In 2005 he warned that Gaza would become “Hamastan”. In 2014 he said “Hamas is <small>ISIS</small>”<small>.</small> After the October 7th massacre of over 1,000 Israelis and over 200 taken hostage, Mr Netanyahu’s war cabinet directed the Israeli army to destroy Hamas. Once Gaza is free from Hamas, there may be hope for peace.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Dr Ophir Falk<br/></small>Foreign policy adviser to the prime minister of Israel<i><br/>Jerusalem</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">If Hamas was hiding in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem, would Israel bomb those Israeli cities to bits to get at them? When Britain suffered from despicable <small>IRA</small> terrorism in the 1970s, was peace achieved by the British government reducing the supposedly<small> IRA</small>-supporting West Belfast to rubble?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Kim Mathen<br/></small><i>London</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">You refer to a social contract between the state of Israel and its people. You also advocate developing a moderate leadership among the Palestinians. But potential moderate leaderships in the past have been undermined by extremists on both sides. There is no evidence that either Israel or the Palestinians would have any confidence in a future moderate leader’s ability to resolve the issues. It is more likely that if Hamas is destroyed it would eventually be replaced by yet another extreme organisation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It may be anathema to the Israelis, but the only alternative is to start talking to Hamas now. Yes, Hamas would proclaim a victory, but does that really matter when the lives of civilians on both sides are at stake? Only by negotiating can Israel secure its social contract with its citizens.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>John Davey<br/></small><i>Portishead, Somerset</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Netanyahu is totally dependent on hardline, right-wing, Jewish supremacist, coalition partners to stay in power. The aim of these coalition partners is a full Israeli armed occupation of Gaza, followed by a re-founding of all the settlements that were destroyed when Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005. Given the choice between doing what is good for the country or keeping his coalition partners happy Mr Netanyahu always chooses the latter.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">I look forward to the day when Israel is no longer governed by him and his supremacist supporters. Perhaps then, Israel will be able to engage with its partners and allies in the international community to rebuild Gaza free from the barbaric tyranny of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and thus enable Israelis to live securely within our borders.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Andrew Goldman<br/></small><i>Beit Shemesh, Israel</i></p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Palestinian-Americans and their supporters march in Chicago, USA" data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231104_IRP001.jpg" srcset="../image/20231104_IRP001.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Reuters</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The public in many countries tends to support the little guy against the big, the weak versus the strong, David against Goliath (<a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/28/the-culture-war-over-the-gaza-war" target="_blank">“The culture war over the Gaza war</a>”, November 4th). In its early days tiny Israel was the David and the much larger Arab states surrounding it were the Goliath.

What Israel lacks is any clear idea of the result it is realistically trying to achieve. Mr Netanyahu has avoided any serious effort to make progress towards a two-state solution. In fact he endeavoured to weaken the moderate Palestinian leadership and has instead strengthened Hamas with the expectation that Israel could perpetuate the expansion of the West Bank settlements and keep the lid on incursions from Gaza. The only outcome that will be beneficial to Israel is a political agreement that ends Israel’s occupation and facilitates Palestinian self-determination.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Michael Hirst<br/></small><i>Pangbourne, Berkshire</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Pity the job of a newspaper editor during war in the Middle East.

I’m waiting for other news media to take an honest look at the viability of a Palestinian state: broken into pieces, lacking social cohesion and wretchedly poor.

He spared no effort in encouraging both young and old to hail entrepreneurship and embrace the new. When WeChat first came out, the app endured attacks from many Chinese, especially those who were traditional and dubious of the positive impacts brought about by this platform. Li, at the time, refused to impose dogmatic regulations on WeChat, and instead gave it a greater freedom to develop on its own. Years later, when WeChat became viral, he mused that “if we used traditional ways to regulate WeChat, then it would not have been able to evolve to its current state.” He was patient and curious to see how innovation changed the lifestyle of the Chinese.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Jack Wang<br/></small><i>Beijing</i></p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">A cultured argument</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">As a Hellenophile and feta aficionado (fetaficionado?)

Feta is far from insipid and varies from mild to salty and smooth to crumbly depending on the terroir, fermentation process and combination of sheep or goat milk used. Some fetas are so tangy as to raise eyebrows. But perhaps Bartleby was referring to the fake feta produced outside Greece which is often bland, innocuous and adulterated with cow milk. In which case I would urge him to experience the inspirational qualities of real feta although the slur will unfortunately remain a fet’accompli.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Lucie Wuethrich<br/></small><i>Bern (canton), Switzerland</i></p></div></section></body>
