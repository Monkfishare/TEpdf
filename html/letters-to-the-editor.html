As you noted, one of the paper’s main arguments concerns the effects of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which lowered tax rates on corporate income, capital income and marginal personal income, but sought to minimise revenue loss by repealing the investment tax credit and other deductions for individuals and businesses. Messrs Auten and Splinter argue that the reform brought a good deal of previously sheltered income into the open. However, the law also created a favourable tax regime for S corporations, a form of “pass-through” company, in which income from the business is taxed as personal income at a lower rate.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In the first year following the law’s enactment, the number of S corporation tax returns jumped by 36.5%, and continued to grow. This change in tax law did not spur a burst of new entrepreneurial activity or job growth, but did propel the growth of high-end incomes. By now, over two-thirds of those in the top 1% of income earners own pass-through companies, so this tax-code provision has been very favourable to those at the top.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Messrs Auten and Splinter also ignore other evidence that runs counter to their argument. For example, by a number of measures, incomes have risen fastest for the very highest segments of the top 1%; indeed, the narrower and higher the slice, the higher the growth of income. Note that the same is true for wealth. The Credit Suisse Global Wealth Reports indicate that mean adult wealth in the United States rose almost 2.2 times from 2005 to 2023. However, the mean wealth of the <i>Forbes</i> wealthiest 400 Americans rose 3.9 times. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Moreover, Messrs Auten and Splinter overlook evidence about how unreported income is distributed. Research shows that the lion’s share of unreported income goes to the top end of the distribution. For example, the counties with the highest rates of underreporting are the highest-income counties. Internal Revenue Service audits find that the share of tax returns for which third-party documentation is lacking, particularly for pass-through businesses such as partnerships and S corporations, account for higher shares of unreported income. Probably 60% of unreported income is distributed to the top decile in America.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In sum, Messrs Auten and Splinter have not provided a convincing refutation of the research by Piketty, Saez and Zucman on inequality.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Thomas Remington<br/></small>Visiting professor of government<br/>Harvard University<i><br/>Cambridge, Massachusetts</i></p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231202_FBD001.jpg" srcset="../image/20231202_FBD001.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/></figure></div><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Russia v Denmark</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">One thing missing from your briefing on Russia (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/30/how-putin-is-reshaping-russia-to-keep-his-war-machine-running" target="_blank">For the Fatherland</a>”, December 2nd) was the country’s declining performance in scientific and technological research and development. For example, in 1989 Russia and Denmark were within a few ticks of each other on tables of scientific and technological achievement. Indeed, according to the <small>OECD,</small> in 1989, Russia spent more on <small>R&amp;D</small> as a percentage of its <small>GDP</small> than Denmark. Within a decade, that had dropped to less than half that of Denmark. In 1995 Russia had a higher ratio of technical workers; 8.6 per 1,000 members of the workforce compared with Denmark’s 5.6. By the 2020s the number for Russia had plunged to 5.3 (Denmark’s had surged to 14.5).</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In 1989 Russia published around 1.8m scientific articles, and Denmark about a quarter of that. By the 2000s, Denmark has doubled its relative productivity in that area. Denmark was already ahead of Russia in terms of quality measures at the time, but the gap widened considerably over the following decades.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">On most of today’s tables ranking the main science-producing countries, Denmark is near the top and Russia is towards the bottom. The significant divergence of performance between these two countries reflects the importance of science and technology policy in supporting a thriving economy, and suggests that Russia’s future economic prospects are built on a flimsy base.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Professor Caroline Wagner<br/></small>Ohio State University<i><br/>Columbus</i></p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="People travelling in the tube" data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231209_BRD001.jpg" srcset="../image/20231209_BRD001.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Holly Stapleton</span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Poor mental-health services</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">I have been a psychiatrist in London’s East End for 35 years. The bulk of our work lies at the beguiling interface between mild and severe mental-health illness (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/12/07/britains-mental-health-crisis-is-a-tale-of-unintended-consequences" target="_blank">Time to rethink</a>”, December 9th). Complexity is in the eyes of the beholder. Meanwhile, the cruel elision of austerity and covid continues. It is now routine for a frightened, hallucinating person to be hospitalised (if we can find a bed) only to be discharged without any meaningful assessment in order to make way for another patient, deemed more severe at that moment. If a bed is found, it is often far from the patient’s support network, assuming that he or she has one.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Modern managerialism, choosing price over value, has dismantled formerly tight-knit, well-honed multidisciplinary teams into a fragmented maze of specialisms, often based on diagnoses of questionable value. The patient’s experience today involves a solitary wandering between services with waiting lists now measured in years. The system now serves itself rather than the patient, providing a convenient lattice of storage silos for distress and discontent, not unlike the asylums of old, but with fewer bricks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In these uncertain times we choose the illusory comfort of rational abstractions, such as pills, Greek-sounding diagnoses and quick therapies, over the messy, more demanding need for an empathic, trusting professional relationship which endures over time. Until we return our over-cherished reason to its proper place alongside embodied emotion, hope, imagination and our need to belong, we will continue to get the mental services that we deserve.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Dr Mark Salter <br/></small>Consultant psychiatrist <br/>East London Foundation Trust <i><br/>London</i></p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt='An illustration of a woman pulling a bunch of balloons behind her.

There were two American precursors for this take on manic Monday. “Monday, Monday”, a number-one hit by The Mamas &amp; the Papas, contained the forlorn lyric that “whenever Monday comes, you can find me cryin’ all the time”. And “Rainy Days and Mondays” by the Carpenters found that Mondays “always get me down”. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Bill Stepp<br/></small><i>New York</i></p></div></section></body>
