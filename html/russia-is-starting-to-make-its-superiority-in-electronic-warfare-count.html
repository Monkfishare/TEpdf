But a less discussed weakness lies in <a href="https://www.economist.com/military-terms-a-to-z#E">electronic warfare</a> (<small>EW</small>); something that Ukraine’s Western supporters have so far shown little interest in tackling.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Russia, says Seth Jones of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington, has for many years placed a “huge focus” on using its military-industrial complex to produce and develop an impressive range of <small>EW </small>capabilities to counter <small>NATO</small>’s highly networked systems. But Ukraine, according to its commander-in-chief, <a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/11/01/the-commander-in-chief-of-ukraines-armed-forces-on-how-to-win-the-war">General Valery Zaluzhny</a>, found itself at the beginning of the war with mainly Soviet-era <small>EW </small>systems. Initially the discrepancy had only limited impact, but as relatively static lines of contact have emerged Russia has been able to position its formidable <small>EW </small>assets where they can have the greatest effect.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590" data-component="infobox"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Ukraine discovered in March that its Excalibur <small>GPS</small>-guided shells suddenly started going off-target, thanks to Russian jamming. Something similar started happening to the <small>JDAM-ER</small> guided bombs that America had supplied to the Ukrainian air force, while Ukraine’s <small>HIMARS</small>-launched <small>GMLRS </small>long-range rockets also started missing their targets. In some areas, a majority of <small>GMLRS </small>rounds now go astray.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Even more worrying has been the increasing ability of Russian <small>EW </small>to counter the multitudes of cheap <a href="https://www.economist.com/military-terms-a-to-z#U">unmanned aerial vehicles</a> (<small>UAV</small>s) that Ukraine has been using for everything from battlefield reconnaissance and communications to exploding on impact against targets such as tanks or command nodes.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Ukraine has trained an army of some 10,000 drone pilots who are now constantly engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with increasingly adept Russian <small>EW </small>operators. The favoured drones are cheap, costing not much more than $1,000 each, and Ukraine is building enormous quantities of them. But losses to Russian <small>EW</small>, which either scrambles their guidance systems or jams their radio-control links with their operators, have at times been running at over 2,000 a week. The smitten drones hover aimlessly until their batteries run out and they fall to the ground.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Neither hardening them against jamming nor investing them with artificial intelligence to fly without a live link to a human operator are feasible options yet, at least for mini-drones. Quantity still wins out over quality, but Russia may have an advantage there too. The skies over the battlefield are now thick with Russian drones. Around Bakhmut, Ukrainian soldiers estimate that Russia is deploying twice the number of assault drones they are able to.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Growing Russian success in the drone war is partly explained by the density of <small>EW </small>systems it is able to field, thanks to those years of investment. A report published in May by Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds of <small>RUSI</small>, a think-tank in London, reckoned the Russians are fielding one major <small>EW </small>system every 10km along the frontline. They think that among many Russian <small>EW </small>systems the truck-mounted Shipovnic-Aero (pictured) is proving especially deadly to Ukrainian drones. The system has a 10km range and can take over control of the drone, while acquiring the co-ordinates of the place from where it is being piloted, with an accuracy of one metre, for transmission to an artillery battery.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Starting from a much lower level of technical and operational skill, Ukraine is struggling to develop home-grown <small>EW </small>capabilities to match those of the Russians. Some progress is being made. The nationwide Pokrova system is being deployed. It can both suppress satellite-based navigation systems, such as Russia’s <small>GLONASS</small>, and spoof them by replacing genuine signals with false ones, making the missile think it is somewhere it is not.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Pokrova should be highly effective against the Iranian-designed Shahed-136 loitering munition, but less so against cruise missiles that rely more on terrain-matching systems, which compare the ground below to a library of stored images rather than being guided all the way in. As well as Pokrova, so-called “Frankenstein” systems, cobbled together with typically Ukrainian ingenuity by combining Soviet systems with more modern technology, are also making an appearance.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But what is missing is much in the way of help from Ukraine’s Western allies when it comes to the <small>EW </small>contest with Russia. Mr Jones says that, as far as America is concerned, that is not likely to change. <small>EW </small>falls into a category of technology transfer restricted by an export-control regime that is rigidly policed by the State Department.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Nico Lange, an expert on Ukraine with the Munich Security Conference, is similarly pessimistic. For one thing, he suspects that <small>NATO’</small>s<small> </small>capabilities may not be as good as Russia’s. Worse, when it comes to the latest systems, he thinks that there is also some reluctance, especially on the part of the Americans, to show Russia its hand because actionable information, for instance on the frequencies and the channel-hopping techniques employed, is likely to be passed on to the Chinese.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Where the West could help directly, says Mr Lange, is to use its long-range <a href="https://www.economist.com/military-terms-a-to-z#D">surveillance drones</a> for more systematic collection of data on Russian jamming and spoofing techniques and to work with the Ukrainians on developing counters to them. Otherwise, it looks as though Ukraine is fated to have to meet its urgent <small>EW </small>challenge largely on its own. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><i>Stay on top of our defence and international security coverage with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-war-room">The War Room</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section></body>
