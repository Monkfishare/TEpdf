Growth in demand continues to be ho-ho-hum. That other implausible global delivery maestro, the stork, has been slacking, so our global customer base has expanded by just 130m infants this year, down from 144m in 2012, bringing the total addressable market to just over 2bn under-15-year-olds. We thus made 2023 the “year of efficiency”, like Meta but jollier.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In particular, we invested heavily in our technological capabilities, to streamline operations, avoid supply-chain bottlenecks and contain costs. Start with logistics. We are ramping up use of <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/12/18/delivery-robots-will-transform-christmas">sidewalk robots</a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/12/18/delivery-robots-will-transform-christmas">drones</a> and <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/12/19/a-new-type-of-jet-engine-could-revive-supersonic-air-travel">hypersonic jets</a>. This provides a convenient way to put Donner, Blitzen and the rest of the herd out to pasture, while burnishing our <small>ESG</small> credentials by dispelling complaints about animal cruelty.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Satellite production sites near big population centres are being equipped with additive-manufacturing tools, popularly known as 3<small>D </small>printers. Like Alstom, a French maker of trains, which boasts of having printed 150,000 spare parts at its depots around the world, we are making our toy locomotives locally. This helps us avoid supply disruptions, such as those causing some competitors problems in the Red Sea. It will also help us avoid overstocking stocking-fillers. Our green footprint is benefiting from advances in the circular economy. Toys that end up broken by Twelfth Night—which in some years is most of them—are increasingly being recycled into raw materials for the 3<small>D</small> printers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Our new Santa App for i<small>OS</small> and Android offers computer-aided design software for fully customisable gifts. This took inspiration from the system launched in May by Nike for its trainers, and lets us make individualised items at little or no added cost. Forget scientist Barbie: we can do “irritating nine-year-old Jane Smith from Brighton” Barbie. Parents will love it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Technology is curbing other costs, starting with labour—a blessing in a time of worker shortages. Because 3<small>D</small> printers work autonomously, productivity per remaining pixie has surged. Shortages among service elves are being allayed with the help of Claus<small>GPT</small>, our proprietary chatbot. It can parse incoming correspondence and field complaints. Not loving little Jimmy’s new drum kit? We hope Claus<small>GPT</small> suggests earplugs, not violence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Virtual <small>AI</small> avatars of Father Christmas reduce the strain on our chief executive. Ozempic, the hot obesity drug of 2023, reduces the strain on his health-insurance bill. It also lowers our key-man risk, which independent analysts now put below that for Elon Musk or Sam Altman.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">To limit production costs, we have adopted the open-source <small>RISC</small>-<small>V</small> architecture for microchips, which these days feature in most of our products (and everybody else’s). This lets us avoid paying licence fees for semiconductors; Nvidia and its shareholders don’t need any more presents this year. With the promised phase-out of coal, just agreed at the <small>un</small>’s climate summit, the lumps for the badly behaved should become cheaper, too. Superbrats may even get two lumps.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In the spirit of Christmas disclosure, we wish to highlight a number of risks to our business. Some of our new technologies are dual-use, so government export controls threaten deployment. The spread of solar panels, already covering 4m residential roofs in our biggest market, America, is making landings treacherous. Efforts to insulate homes and substitute heat pumps for fireplaces are leading to access problems.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Snow laughing matter </h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">And we cannot count on Amazon and Alibaba, our chief rivals, to remain on regulators’ naughty lists for ever. But we firmly believe that these risks are under control. In the worst-case scenario, we can always fall back on miracles. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body>
