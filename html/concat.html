Democrats rage about how re-electing Donald Trump would doom their country’s democracy. And yet, in deciding who to put up against him in November’s election, the party looks as if it will meekly submit to the candidacy of an 81-year-old with the worst approval rating of any modern president at this stage in his term. How did it come to this?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Joe Biden’s net approval rating stands at minus 16 points. Mr Trump, leading polls in the swing states where the election will be decided, is a coin-toss away from a second presidential win. Even if you do not see Mr Trump as a potential dictator, that is an alarming prospect. A substantial share of Democrats would rather Mr Biden did not run. But instead of either challenging him or knuckling down to support his campaign, they have instead taken to muttering glassy-eyed about the mess they are in.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">There are no secrets about what makes Mr Biden so unpopular. Part of it is the sustained burst of inflation that has been laid at his door. Then there is his age. Most Americans know someone in their 80s who is starting to show their years. They also know that no matter how fine that person’s character, they should not be given a four-year stint in the world’s hardest job.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Back in 2023 Mr Biden could—and should—have decided to be a one-term president. He would have been revered as a paragon of public service and a rebuke to Mr Trump’s boundless ego. Democratic bigwigs know this. In fact before their party’s better-than-expected showing in the midterms, plenty of party members thought that Mr Biden would indeed stand aside. This newspaper first argued that the president should not seek re-election over a year ago.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Unfortunately, Mr Biden and his party had several reasons for him fighting one more campaign, none of them good. His sense of duty was tainted by vanity. Having first stood for president in 1987 and laboured for so long to sit behind the Resolutedesk, he has been seduced into believing that his country needs him because he is a proven Trump-beater.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Likewise, his staff’s desire to serve has surely been tainted by ambition. It is in the nature of administrations that many of a president’s closest advisers will never again be so close to power. Of course they do not want to see their man surrender the White House in order to focus on his presidential library.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Democratic leaders have been cowardly and complacent. Like many pusillanimous congressional Republicans, who disliked Mr Trump and considered him dangerous—but could not find it within themselves to impeach or even criticise him—Democratic stalwarts have been unwilling to act on their concerns about Mr Biden’s folly. If that was because of the threat to their own careers, their behaviour was cowardly. If it was thinking that Mr Trump is his own worst enemy, it was complacent. Mr Biden’s approval ratings have continued to slide, while the 91 criminal charges Mr Trump faces have, so far, only made him stronger.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Given this, you might think that the best thing would be for Mr Biden to stand aside. After all, the election is still ten months away and the Democratic Party has talent. Alas, not only is that exceedingly unlikely, but the closer you look at what would happen, finding an <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b">alternative to Mr Biden</a> at this stage would be a desperate and unwise throw of the dice .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Were he to withdraw today, the Democratic Party would have to frantically recast its primary, because filing deadlines have already passed in many states and the only other candidates on the ballot are a little-known congressman called Dean Phillips and a self-help guru called Marianne Williamson. Assuming this was possible, and that the flurry of ensuing lawsuits was manageable, state legislatures would have to approve new dates for the primaries closer to the convention in August. A series of debates would have to be organised so that primary voters knew what they were voting for. The field could well be vast, with no obvious way of narrowing it quickly: in the Democratic primary of 2020, 29 candidates put themselves forward.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The chaos might be worth it if the party could be sure of going into the election with a young, electable candidate. However, it seems equally possible that the eventual winner would be unelectable—Bernie Sanders, say, a self-declared democratic socialist who is a year older than Mr Biden. More likely, the nomination would go to Kamala Harris, the vice-president. Ms Harris has the advantage of not being old, though it says something about the Democratic Party’s gerontocracy that she will be 60 in November and is considered youthful.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Unfortunately she has proven to be a poor communicator, a disadvantage in office as well as on the stump. Ms Harris is a creature of California’s machine politics and has never successfully appealed to voters outside her state. Her campaign in 2020 was awful. Her autocue sometimes seems to have been hacked by a satirist. Immigration and the southern border—a portfolio she handles for Mr Biden—is Mr Trump’s strongest issue and the Democrats’ weakest. Ms Harris’s chances of beating Mr Trump look even worse than her boss’s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Better, therefore, for Democrats to focus on electing Mr Biden. The economy promises a soft landing; workers are seeing real-wage growth and full employment. Were Mr Trump convicted, he could yet be punished by voters. Most important is to invigorate the campaign. Democrats need to unlock some excitement and create a sense of possibility about a second term.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Ridin’ with Biden</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The president is not a good campaigner and is up against a candidate whose rallies are a cult meeting crossed with a vaudeville show. He needs someone who can speak to crowds and go on television for him. That person is not Ms Harris.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">One way she could serve her party and her country, and help keep Mr Trump out of the White House, would be to forswear another term as vice-president. Mr Biden could present his second term as a different kind of presidency, one in which he would share more responsibility with a vice-president acting more like a <small>CEO</small>. Either way, Mr Biden needs the help of an army of enthusiastic Democrats willing to campaign alongside him. At the moment he and his party are sleepwalking towards disaster. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/leaders/"><span>Leaders</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Mayhem in the Middle East</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Binyamin Netanyahu is botching the war.

Israel’s northern border is tense after the assassination of a Hamas leader in Beirut on January 2nd. A day later two explosions killed almost 100 people in Iran; the Iranians at first blamed “terrorists”, and then America and Israel. War could break out between Israel and <a href="https://www.economist.com/films/2023/10/27/what-is-hizbullah">Hizbullah</a>, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon. Two things are clear. The attacks of October 7th are reshaping the Middle East. And under Binyamin Netanyahu’s leadership, Israel is making blunders that undermine its own security.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Since the slaughter of Israeli civilians by Hamas in October, Israel has had to rethink its long-standing security doctrine. That doctrine involved giving up on peace with the Palestinians, building walls and using technology to repel missile attacks and infiltrations. It didn’t work. The Palestinians were radicalised and the walls did not stop the atrocities of October 7th. Israel’s air defences may yet be overwhelmed by the increasingly sophisticated arsenal of missiles aimed at it by Iran-backed militants in Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere.</p><aside class="css-d2tu32 e1x5fpv0" data-component="infobox"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas"></a></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">How might a new Israeli security doctrine work? supports removing Hamas from power in Gaza: it has oppressed and impoverished the people there. It is also an impediment to peace. But Israel should make clear its fight is with the terrorists. That means using force judiciously and letting in a lot more aid. It also means having a plan for after the war that creates a path to a moderate Palestinian state. Such an approach would help maintain support for Israel in America and elsewhere. This is crucial: America deters Iran and backs detente between Israel and Gulf states that also oppose Iran’s influence. Most important, it underwrites the security of Israel itself.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Alas, in Gaza, Mr Netanyahu has eschewed this logic. Israel’s tactics show needless disregard for civilian lives. The Hamas-run authorities there say 22,000 civilians and fighters have died. The <small>UN</small> says another 7,000 may lie under the rubble. Israel says it has killed 8,000 terrorists. Far too little water, food and medicine is reaching Gaza and there are no truly safe zones for civilians. Mr Netanyahu seems to have no post-war plan, other than anarchy or occupation. He has excluded rule by the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. Extremists in his coalition talk, outrageously, of permanently displacing Palestinians from the enclave.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">What explains this myopia? It is true that Israeli public opinion shows little sympathy for the Palestinians and that the obliteration of Gaza may help restore Israel’s deterrent power. Yet the main explanation is Mr Netanyahu’s weakness. Desperate to stay in office, he has pandered to extremists in his coalition and the Israeli electorate, while testing America’s patience and horrifying Arab states. That will backfire in Gaza and hinder Israel from dealing with its own broader security concerns.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Take the northern front: the threat of a Hizbullah invasion or missile strikes<sup> </sup>means that a strip of northern Israel is now uninhabited. Yet Israel’s options are grim. A pre-emptive invasion of Lebanon could lead to a military quagmire, trigger the complete collapse of the Lebanese state and wreck relations with America. Diplomacy might create a buffer zone between Hizbullah and Israel’s border, but a regional plan is needed to contain and deter Iran. That requires the support of America, other Western allies and, ideally, the Gulf Arab states, all of which Mr Netanyahu is alienating.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Netanyahu’s popularity at home has plummeted. Israel’s Supreme Court has just struck down his controversial judicial overhaul. For Israel’s sake, he has to go. Given the trauma of October 7th, his successor will not be soft on security. But a wiser Israeli leader might understand that famine in Gaza, anarchy or open-ended occupation there and the erosion of American backing will not make Israel safer. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/leaders/"><span>Leaders</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Stockmarkets</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Is America’s raging bull market exhausted, or taking a breath?</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Investors have a slight hangover</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_LDD003.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>f you had </small>an overindulgent Christmas, you may have begun the new year in a more austere frame of mind.

The <small>s</small>&amp;<small>p</small> 500 rose by 14% in the final two months of 2023, and towers 31% above its most recent trough, well above the 20% that is often used to define a bull market.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The explanation for the run was a happy mix of strong economic growth, an orderly reduction of inflation and, crucially, an enormous shift in interest-rate expectations over the past two months. <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/03/has-america-really-escaped-inflation">America’s economy</a> expanded at an impressive annualised pace of 4.9% in the third quarter; real-time estimates suggest it grew at a still-robust 2.5% in the last three months of the year. In the past three months “core” consumer prices have risen at an average annualised pace of just 2.2%, only a smidgen above the Federal Reserve’s inflation target.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">That led to a big shift in investors’ expectations for interest rates. In October they thought one-year rates in a year’s time would be close to 5%. Thanks to lower inflation data and a doveish set of forecasts from the Fed, that has fallen to 3.5%. Bond investors see the central bank cutting rates as soon as March—and continuing in almost every meeting in 2024. This tantalising prospect of immaculate disinflation, robust growth and the promise of easier monetary policy has underpinned the rally.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Can the bull market be sustained? Asset prices still have room to rise. Although markets are close to the heights they reached after the protracted mania of 2021, that does not mean that things are as excessive now as they were then. In real terms, stock prices remain lower; valuations are therefore not quite as elevated. Participation by retail investors, which reached a giddy peak of 24% of daily trading volumes in early 2021, was steady at around 18% in 2023.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Moreover, although tech led the charge in both 2021 and 2023, investors this time have been discerning. They have lifted up Nvidia and Microsoft but Alphabet, Amazon and Tesla are all trading below their peak valuations. It is not just Americans excited about <small>AI</small> who are buoying stocks: in dollar terms European and Japanese equity indices are also within touching distance of their level two years ago.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Rude awakening</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Yet everything hangs on whether investors’ ideal economic scenario comes to pass. The expectation that it will helped lift stocks close to a record high last year. But risks to the outlook abound, and may have given investors pause in the cold light of January. Inflation in America may not be fully vanquished, not least with the economy still in rude health and the fiscal deficit unusually wide. Strife in the Middle East could cause another commodity-price shock; the one-time easing of the supply-chain disruptions of the pandemic may be keeping inflation low only temporarily.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A downturn may merely be delayed, not dodged. Rises in interest rates may not yet have fully fed through to borrowers. Indeed, history suggests that recessions are hard to spot in real time, and tend to catch out central banks. If a recession does not arrive, it is still possible that the Fed will not move with as much alacrity as investors hope. To see what will happen in the markets in 2024, watch the real economy.  <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/leaders/"><span>Leaders</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Towering ambition</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Can India, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia be the next great economies?</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Meet the countries making bold—and risky—bets on growth </h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_LDD002.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">P</span><small>oliticians and</small> policymakers all over the world share a preoccupation: how to make their countries richer. The trouble is that the route to prosperity looks ever more daunting. The global economy is changing, as new, green technologies emerge and trading relationships fragment. In countries that are already rich the state, after decades of free-market rhetoric, is back in a big way. Governments are spending hundreds of billions on handouts for industries they deem to be strategically important.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In the face of this, many <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/02/how-to-get-rich-in-the-21st-century">developing countries’ ideas for growth</a> are staggeringly ambitious. India and Indonesia hope to become high-income countries within 25 years. Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, wants to diversify and develop its economy just as rapidly. Refreshingly, such plans are more outward-looking than many development strategies of old. But they contain pitfalls, too.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In many ways, the developing world is choosing to bank on globalisation. Indonesia wants a bigger role in green supply chains. It seeks to do everything from mining and refining nickel, even to building the electric vehicles that run on it. It then wants to export the finished products to the rest of the world. Countries in the Gulf want to become attractive homes for global business, and are opening up to flows of people, cargo and cash. Narendra Modi envisions India as a high-tech manufacturer for the world, churning out microchips and smartphones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">That is a welcome shift. Less than 50 years ago India hoped to grow by closing itself off from the global economy. It turned out to be an approach that failed miserably. Some still suggest that India’s domestic demand could carry its growth.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But serving foreign markets plays a vital role in development. It keeps firms honest, by forcing them to compete in markets that their governments do not control. It lets them reach the largest possible scale. And foreign customers can teach firms how to serve them better. In East Asia export performance was also a useful yardstick for policymakers, because it revealed which industries deserved their continued backing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Nonetheless, today’s development strategies also hold dangers. In many countries governments are running the risk of warping the economy in the name of nurturing it. Saudi Arabia’s onslaught of industrial policy, mainly disbursed as handouts from the Public Investment Fund, exceeds the spending even of America’s Inflation Reduction Act. In order to help exporters grow, India is seeking to fence off its high-tech manufacturers behind tariffs and subsidies. Indonesia’s all-in bet on nickel leaves it perilously exposed, should other battery chemistries prevail.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The rich world’s new-found zeal for protectionism may make it tempting for poorer countries to follow suit. Yet floods of cash and shelter from foreign competition make it impossible to know whether a government’s development gambles are paying off. A bet on one technology could go wrong if others emerge.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Parts of the developing world have paid dearly to learn these lessons before. For most of the 1960s Africa’s policymakers had the same ideas as East Asia’s, and the continent grew as fast, until picking the wrong champions left it languishing between 1975 and 1985. It is the poorest region in the world today.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Picking winners is also harder than it was 60 years ago. Then the choice was over which form of manufacturing to promote. Cheap, abundant workforces gave poor countries an edge. Manufacturing was the only sector in which poor countries got better faster than rich countries.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Today, however, factories have become more capital-intensive. Though manufacturing still offers a way to boost a country’s productivity, it is less certain to become a poor country’s comparative advantage. That makes it even harder for policymakers to spot a good industry for them to place their bets. Rather than gambling with the public’s money, they would be better off keeping it off the table.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">There are, after all, plenty of other worthwhile things to spend it on. The state has a vital role in providing public goods by investing in infrastructure to stitch regions together, or education to boost workers’ skills. That might still favour some industries over others. But if economies stay open, then they will at least experience the disciplines and benefits of trade.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Vision 2050 </h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The stakes are high. The developing world is home to over 6bn people and some of the most fragile democracies. Getting growth wrong would keep such places poorer for longer. That would be not just a human tragedy, but also a potential source of political instability. To avert it, the developing world needs to be bold—and resist the urge to build walls around itself. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/leaders/"><span>Leaders</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Is Putin winning?</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">How backing Ukraine is key to the West’s security</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">And why its leaders need to start saying so</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_LDP001.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">W</span><small>HAT DO YOU </small>do when words start to fail you?

His central argument is that when the West helps Ukraine it is acting in its own interests. “Giving us money or giving us weapons, you support yourself,” he told us. “You save your children, not ours.” Mr Zelensky is right.

Those arguments are wrong.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Despite its military setback, Ukraine can win this war by emerging as a thriving, Western-leaning democracy. Defeating Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is not about retaking territory so much as showing the Kremlin that his invasion is a futile exercise robbing Russia of its young men and its future.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">With money, arms and real progress on the accession of Ukraine to the <small>EU</small>, that is still possible. In 2024 a focus of Ukrainian fighting is likely to be Crimea, while the front lines on the mainland shift only slightly. This peninsula is a vital supply route for Russian forces in southern Ukraine; annexing it in 2014 was a propaganda triumph for Mr Putin. Successful Ukrainian attacks on Crimea will both hurt Russia’s capabilities and embarrass Mr Putin. An example was the sinking of the , a large landing ship berthed in Feodosia on the south coast of the peninsula, on December 26th.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">By contrast, if Mr Putin sees that the West has lost faith in Ukraine, he will not stop. He needs war as an excuse for his repressive rule. Visiting a military hospital on January 1st, he declared his hostility towards Western countries: “The point is not that they are helping our enemy,” he said. “They are our enemy.” Those who argue that Russia is not strong enough to pose a threat to the West are forgetting that the Russian army is learning new tactics in Ukraine. Speaking at the hospital, Mr Putin added that Russia is re-equipping itself for war faster than the West is—and he is right.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Russia does not have to mount another full invasion to wreck <small>NATO</small>. A provocation against, say, a Baltic state could prise apart the alliance’s pledge that an attack on one member is an attack on all. Were Ukraine to fail because of a lack of Western resolve, especially in America, challenges to the United States—including by China, Iran and North Korea—would become more likely.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">If Russia is a threat and Ukraine can win, then helping it is not a waste of money. That $61bn to help Ukraine (some of which is, anyway, spent in America and <small>NATO</small> countries) is just 6.9% of America’s defence budget. The <small>EU</small>’s spending on Ukraine is a tiny fraction of its member states’ <small>GDP</small>. The cost of re-establishing deterrence against Russia would be far greater than the cost of backing Ukraine to win. So would the extra cost of defending American interests around the world, including against China. An actual war with Russia—with its risk of nuclear escalation—could be catastrophic.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">No longer can Western leaders leave the talking to Mr Zelensky.

As you noted, one of the paper’s main arguments concerns the effects of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which lowered tax rates on corporate income, capital income and marginal personal income, but sought to minimise revenue loss by repealing the investment tax credit and other deductions for individuals and businesses. Messrs Auten and Splinter argue that the reform brought a good deal of previously sheltered income into the open. However, the law also created a favourable tax regime for S corporations, a form of “pass-through” company, in which income from the business is taxed as personal income at a lower rate.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In the first year following the law’s enactment, the number of S corporation tax returns jumped by 36.5%, and continued to grow. This change in tax law did not spur a burst of new entrepreneurial activity or job growth, but did propel the growth of high-end incomes. By now, over two-thirds of those in the top 1% of income earners own pass-through companies, so this tax-code provision has been very favourable to those at the top.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Messrs Auten and Splinter also ignore other evidence that runs counter to their argument. For example, by a number of measures, incomes have risen fastest for the very highest segments of the top 1%; indeed, the narrower and higher the slice, the higher the growth of income. Note that the same is true for wealth. The Credit Suisse Global Wealth Reports indicate that mean adult wealth in the United States rose almost 2.2 times from 2005 to 2023. However, the mean wealth of the  wealthiest 400 Americans rose 3.9 times. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Moreover, Messrs Auten and Splinter overlook evidence about how unreported income is distributed. Research shows that the lion’s share of unreported income goes to the top end of the distribution. For example, the counties with the highest rates of underreporting are the highest-income counties. Internal Revenue Service audits find that the share of tax returns for which third-party documentation is lacking, particularly for pass-through businesses such as partnerships and S corporations, account for higher shares of unreported income. Probably 60% of unreported income is distributed to the top decile in America.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In sum, Messrs Auten and Splinter have not provided a convincing refutation of the research by Piketty, Saez and Zucman on inequality.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Thomas Remington<br/></small>Visiting professor of government<br/>Harvard University</p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231202_FBD001.jpg" srcset="../image/20231202_FBD001.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/></figure></div><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Russia v Denmark</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">One thing missing from your briefing on Russia (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/30/how-putin-is-reshaping-russia-to-keep-his-war-machine-running" target="_blank">For the Fatherland</a>”, December 2nd) was the country’s declining performance in scientific and technological research and development. For example, in 1989 Russia and Denmark were within a few ticks of each other on tables of scientific and technological achievement.

Complexity is in the eyes of the beholder. Meanwhile, the cruel elision of austerity and covid continues.

The most recent to do so was Lyndon Johnson, in 1968. And that is a year that his party, the Democrats, would rather forget. Johnson was unpopular. The country and the party were divided by the Vietnam war and the civil-rights movement. After a surprisingly strong challenge in the first primary, he stood aside, only to unleash chaos. One of the leading candidates to replace him, Robert Kennedy, was assassinated. The nomination was eventually awarded by party grandees to a man who had not won a single primary, Hubert Humphrey. In the end the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon, who had been widely considered unelectable at the beginning of the year, won convincingly. He went on to do more damage to the presidency than anyone bar the Republicans’ likely candidate this year, Donald Trump.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Trump, too, should be unelectable, owing to the 91 felonies with which he has been charged in different parts of America. Yet Joe Biden, the incumbent president, is so unpopular he may well lose to Mr Trump. There have been occasional calls for Mr Biden to step aside, like Johnson. But there is no sign that he is willing to do so and no guarantee that the Democrats would end up with a stronger candidate if he did. For that reason, although many Democratic operatives have grave misgivings about his candidacy, most are keeping quiet. As one puts it, if you’re all stuck on a boat of questionable seaworthiness, it is natural to wish for a finer vessel, but unproductive to poke holes in the hull or stoke a mutiny.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Whitmer and wisdom</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It is Mr Biden’s feeble polling that is seeding the angst. ’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-republican-primaries-tracker">poll tracker for the Republican primary</a> puts Mr Trump more than 50 percentage points ahead of his nearest rival, making him the prohibitive favourite. A polling average for the general election compiled by RealClearPolitics shows Mr Trump ahead of Mr Biden by a margin of 2.3 percentage points. This is well above his showing in the past two presidential contests, in which he consistently lagged in the polls. At this point in 2016 Mr Trump’s support was seven points lower: he trailed Hillary Clinton by a margin of five points. At this point in 2020 he trailed Mr Biden by five points.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">With most states so partisan that they are not worth contesting, the presidential campaign will be centred on six where the outcome is actually uncertain: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Early polling in these states also shows Mr Biden several points behind. And some Democrats fear that these polls may be underestimating Mr Trump’s support, because his conspiracy-minded voters may not be open with those taking the surveys.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="931" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_FBC827.png" srcset="../image/20240106_FBC827.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Underpinning Mr Trump’s strength is a broad political shift. Partisan allegiance in America may seem hysterically entrenched, but in fact it is mutable. White working-class voters powered Mr Trump to victory in 2016; in the years since, the non-white working class has begun to shift, too. Between 2016 and 2020 Hispanic Americans, once fairly loyal Democratic voters, moved 18 points towards the Republicans. Black men are also slowly peeling away from the Democrats. Only the influx of white college graduates has kept the Democratic Party competitive nationally. These demographic trends are sizeable enough to determine the outcome of the election if they persist—and they do appear to be. The latest polls indicate higher support for Mr Trump among African-American and Hispanic voters than he enjoyed in 2020 (see chart 1). “It seems like the 2024 polls right now are 2020 trends carried forward,” says Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Secular trends aside, there is plainly a problem with Mr Biden himself. The president’s net approval rating is -16 points, according to several public polling averages. That is notably worse than Mr Trump’s at this point in his presidency. Voters are worried about his fitness for office. One of YouGov’s weekly polls for  in December found that 55% of Americans think that the 81-year-old Mr Biden’s health and age “severely limit his ability to do the job” of president, including 25% of Democrats. Only 24% of Americans want him to run for president again. Fully 61% of them do not, including 38% of those who voted for him in 2020.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Americans are only marginally more enthusiastic about the 77-year-old Mr Trump’s revenge bid for the White House, but they are much less likely to think that he is too old or frail to resume the office. Mr Biden, after all, did not do much campaigning in 2020, owing to the pandemic. He does not seem to relish the arduous campaign ahead, whereas Mr Trump appears to like nothing better than rambling on in front of adoring crowds. Four years ago Mr Biden reportedly toyed with promising to remain in office for just a single term. “If Trump wasn’t running, I’m not sure I’d be running,” he said to a room full of donors in December. When asked how many other Democrats could beat Mr Trump, he said, “Probably 50 of them…I’m not the only one who could defeat him. But I will defeat him.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">There is almost no chance that Mr Biden will voluntarily abandon his re-election bid. He sees himself as a divinely appointed Trumpbuster and believes his electoral record reflects that. First he vanquished Mr Trump in 2020. Then in the midterm elections of 2022, when Republicans had expected to deliver a terrible rebuke to Democrats, the Democrats’ support held up surprisingly well.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Biden’s supporters, naturally, express great confidence. “If you play poker, which I do, you’d rather have our cards than their cards,” says Jim Messina, the manager of Barack Obama’s successful re-election bid in 2012—although he admits, “This thing will be really close.” The campaign argues that the president has been underestimated before, as in the hotly contested Democratic primary of 2020, when he looked fatally unpopular before suddenly becoming the consensus candidate.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Campaign staffers point to the mid-terms as proof that Republican candidates who champion abortion and reject the election results of 2020 will fare poorly. They argue, correctly, that polls conducted ten months from an election are a poor guide to the outcome. Most voters will not devote much thought to the election for months and the billion-dollar campaign machines are only just gearing up. When Americans are paying more attention, the campaign insists, the spectacle of Mr Trump shuttling between rallies and court appearances will remind Americans of the chaos of his time in office.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Biden’s polling deficit is not insurmountable. Bidenworld also thinks that, with time, voters will give the president more credit for his achievements. The labour market is robust, unemployment is low and wage growth is strongest at the bottom of the income distribution, reducing wage inequality. Inflation, which has infuriated many voters, is abating without a recession. YouGov’s polling for  suggests Americans are unduly gloomy: 58% think the country has high unemployment (it does not); 44% think the country is in a recession (it is not); and 40% think inflation will be higher in six months (quite unlikely). The Democrats are hoping that voters will notice that the economy is doing better than they thought by election day. But Republicans keep talking about “Bidenomics” as a pejorative, suggesting that they doubt the topic will end up helping the president.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Biden’s apologists also argue, in effect, that he will win because he must.  “We’re going to win because democracy and freedom and the very ideas that make America America are on the line. We have no other choice,” says Quentin Fulks, his deputy campaign manager.They see a battle for the very “soul of the nation”, as Mr Biden often says. This is a stirring appeal, but only for the converted. A new study by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group finds that Americans like to invoke democratic norms to chide someone from the opposing party, but are willing to suspend them when it comes to their own preferred candidate. Mr Trump is also muddying things by deploying apocalyptic rhetoric of his own: he has recently taken to calling Mr Biden “the destroyer of American democracy”. Republicans in Congress may pursue a farcical impeachment inquiry against Mr Biden in order to claim that both men are equally disreputable.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Newsom fine day</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Anyway, the end-of-days argument cuts both ways. It could be used to assert that the Democrats cannot risk as weak a candidate as Mr Biden. The party has plenty of non-geriatric politicians who could helm a presidential ticket. The problem is that none of them has dared to enter the primaries, in part for fear that they would not be able to beat Mr Biden and instead would only harm his chances in the general election. Only little-known politicians such as Dean Phillips, a Democratic congressman from Minnesota, have put themselves forward. “President Biden—a man I respect and I think a person of decency and integrity—is perhaps one of the only Democrats who could lose and probably will lose to Donald Trump,” explains Mr Phillips. He says he is merely saying “the quiet part out loud” about the president’s advanced age and unpopularity.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">As reasonable as Mr Phillips’s criticisms may be, his challenge looks doomed (“keep the faith” is one of his catchphrases). He could score unexpectedly highly in the New Hampshire primary, to be held on January 23rd, which Mr Biden is boycotting over a scheduling spat within the Democratic Party. Thereafter, things will be harder. Some states, such as Florida, have in effect cancelled their Democratic primaries altogether, declaring that there is only one qualified candidate. The difficulty of getting on the ballot prompted Robert Kennedy junior, the son of the candidate assassinated in 1968, to abandon an attempt to stand in the primaries against Mr Biden and instead try to get on the ballot in the general election as a third-party candidate.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="626" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_FBC769.png" srcset="../image/20240106_FBC769.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Even if more plausible candidates saw any hope of defeating Mr Biden, they are too late to initiate a serious primary challenge. The deadlines to file as a candidate in the primary have already passed in more than 20 states, and several more loom in early January. In recent years the primary calendar has become much more compressed: most of the almost 4,000 ordinary delegates will be allocated by the end of March (see chart 2), giving an insurgent candidate very little time to gain any momentum.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">All of which suggests that Mr Biden will easily secure his party’s nomination. It is possible, of course, that he might be forced to step aside by what pundits politely call a “health event”. But such an outcome would not necessarily be providential for the Democrats. As when Johnson declared in 1968, “I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president”, pandemonium would probably follow. The party might have to rewrite the rules of the primaries, to allow more candidates late access to the ballot, but even so, the campaign would presumably be nasty, brutish and short. Only a few candidates, with the resources to crank up an electoral machine at short notice, would be able to compete.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Harris teeters</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Kamala Harris, the vice-president, would be the presumptive nominee, with the institutional support of the party behind her and perhaps even Mr Biden’s endorsement. Democrats are a hierarchical bunch. The last time they denied a vice-president seeking the presidential nomination was in 1952. The unfortunate man was Harry Truman’s deputy, Alben Barkley, a septuagenarian whose abysmal eyesight required documents to be set in inch-tall font.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But Ms Harris, who ran a disastrous campaign for the presidency in 2020 that ended before the first votes were cast, would almost certainly attract challengers. Only 36% of Americans think she is qualified to be president, according to YouGov. Only 23% think she would beat Mr Trump (including 43% of those who voted for Mr Biden in 2020 and just 3% of Trump voters). Although it would be awkward in an identity-conscious party to attempt to step over the first black and the first female vice-president, some rivals would probably be willing to take the plunge.</p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20240106_FBD002.jpg" srcset="../image/20240106_FBD002.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Mark Harris</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, is plainly clamouring for the chance to be president, although he denies it, and has built a formidable political machine. The governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has both ambition and an inherited fortune worth billions. But the moderate governors whom many Democrats see as best-placed to take on Mr Trump—such as Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania or Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan—might not have enough money to hand to compete properly in a suddenly open primary or enough time to build a viable campaign. The biggest political talents in Mr Biden’s cabinet, such as Pete Buttigieg, the secretary of transportation, and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, would probably have to resign if they wanted to enter the fray. A coronation of Ms Harris might simply be unavoidable.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">If Mr Biden were forced to abandon his bid for the White House after lots of primaries had concluded, the confusion would be all the more intense. The big parties’ rules for nominating a candidate are fiendishly complicated, but in essence they require a majority of delegates to back the winner at a national convention. For Democrats this will be held in Chicago in August—the same city as the traumatic convention of 1968, where police brutally dispersed anti-war protesters outside while bewildered delegates debated the way forward inside. Normally, most delegates are “pledged” meaning that they are expected to reflect the outcome of the primary in their home state. But if they are pledged to a candidate who is no longer in the race they are treated much as “superdelegates”, the 746 party grandees who get to vote as they please.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">If Mr Biden were to withdraw after winning a big share of delegates, candidates to replace him would be forced to woo the party’s patricians rather than its plebeians. The convention would revert from its present form—a four-day bout of pageantry—to its old-fashioned format: four days of haggling in smoke-filled rooms. Hans Noel, a political scientist at Georgetown University, argues that a contested convention is more likely to produce a candidate able to unite a fractious modern party than the current “sports tournament” system. But most Democratic operatives think the party would emerge more divided rather than united after such tumult. American voters, too, are unused to such machinations. They have not witnessed such a contested convention since 1976, when Republican grandees plumped for Gerald Ford over Ronald Reagan.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">If Mr Biden fell ill and were unable to contest the election after securing the nomination in August, the Democratic National Committee, which consists of a few hundred party operatives, would decide who to place at the top of the ticket. Such a meeting has only been required once before, in 1972, when the Democrats’ vice-presidential candidate, Thomas Eagleton, had to withdraw after revelations that he had suffered from depression and received electroshock therapy. Again, it is likely that the crown would pass in this instance to Ms Harris. Mr Biden appears loyal to her as his running-mate. Yet her shakiness as a candidate is thought to be one of the reasons Mr Biden is reluctant to bow out.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Biden’s swooning poll numbers leave the Democrats in a miserable predicament. The alternatives that might still be possible are not obviously preferable. When asked whether it would be better if Mr Biden withdrew, the party’s preferred public-relations strategy is to pretend that the idea is absurd. Mr Biden’s staffers tell heroic stories about the punishing days he routinely endures and insist that he is so alert, informed and mentally agile that the reporter asking the awkward questions “couldn’t survive a ten-minute policy briefing with the president”. What they really mean is that there is no Plan <small>B</small>. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/united-states/"><span>United States</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->SCOTUS and voters</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">A clash over Trump’s disqualification tests the Supreme Court</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">The justices must try to find a way through a legal and political minefield</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_USP001.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>HE 14th AMENDMENT</small> is no stranger to America’s Supreme Court.

But 156 years after the amendment was ratified, the court now has its first occasion to grapple with a clause that some believe disqualifies Donald Trump from becoming president again.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Section 3 of the 14th Amendment bars those who have sworn an oath to uphold the constitution from federal or state office if they have “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” against the constitution or “given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof”. This rule was designed to keep former Confederate rebels from the levers of power after the Civil War. Few dispute that it applies with equal force to insurrectionists today. The open question is whether Mr Trump’s attempts to secure himself a second term despite losing the 2020 election—culminating in the Capitol riot three years ago—count as an insurrection and so disqualify him from trying to recapture the White House the old-fashioned way.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A flurry of conflicting answers has emerged in recent weeks. On December 19th the Colorado Supreme Court released a ruling that removes Mr Trump from the ballot for the state’s Republican primary on March 5th. Nine days later Shenna Bellows, Maine’s secretary of state, announced that Mr Trump’s role in the January 6th attack made him ineligible to be listed on her state’s primary ballot. (Both decisions are on hold, for now, as appeals proceed.) Ms Bellows’s ruling followed an administrative proceeding in which several residents of the state challenged Mr Trump’s inclusion. She wrote that, although no one in her position “has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access” stemming from a claim under Section 3, “no presidential candidate has ever before engaged in insurrection”. She has a duty, she wrote, to ensure that all candidates on the ballot “are qualified for the office they seek.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">By contrast, Michigan’s highest court rebuffed an invitation to consider a challenge to Mr Trump’s bid to appear on the primary roster. Minnesota’s did, too. Similar attempts have faltered in Florida, New Hampshire and Wisconsin. Others are under way in Oregon, Alaska and eight other states. In California, when the lieutenant-governor implored Shirley Weber, the secretary of state, to find a way to keep Mr Trump’s name off the ballot, Ms Weber demurred. “[I]t is more critical than ever”, she said, “to safeguard elections in a way that transcends political divisions.”</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This disagreement among Democrats in California shows that, though political motives may animate some challenges to Mr Trump under Section 3, responses from officials and scholars have not always fallen along partisan lines. All seven judges on the Colorado Supreme Court were appointed by Democratic governors, but only four signed the opinion removing Mr Trump from the ballot. The three dissenters, without denying that the 45th president had engaged in insurrection, cited various reasons he should not be erased from the ballot: the five-day trial in the lower court was insufficient; applying Section 3 requires an act of Congress; and Mr Trump has not been criminally convicted of insurrection.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">William Baude and Michael Stokes Paulsen, two law professors on the right, reject these arguments and contend in a forthcoming law-review article that it is “unquestionably fair to say that Trump ‘engaged in’ the January 6th insurrection through both his actions and his inaction”. The case, they write, “is not even close”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Messrs Baude and Paulsen are respected scholars with conservative bona fides (Mr Baude clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts), but the Supreme Court may shrink from their politically earthshaking position. The court was widely condemned for interfering in the 2000 election, in effect making George W. Bush the victor over Al Gore. It will be hesitant to shake up the 2024 contest by empowering states to deny voters the chance to opt for the Republican front-runner.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Adam Unikowsky, who has litigated at the Supreme Court and comments on it, writes that disenfranchising millions of Trump voters would seem “insanely anti-democratic”. Yet it will not be a simple matter to reverse the Colorado court decision, he reckons, as its analysis is sound. He puts the chances of the Supreme Court disqualifying Mr Trump at 20%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The review could proceed apace. The Republican Party in Colorado (which on December 27th petitioned the court to scuttle the Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling), Mr Trump himself (who added his appeal on January 3rd) and those supporting Mr Trump’s removal from the ballot have all asked the justices to accelerate their consideration of the cases. On January 2nd Mr Trump appealed against the Maine disqualification to a court in Augusta. It, too, could end up in the Supreme Court.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The justices will juggle this novel constitutional quandary as two more Trump-related cases speed their way to them. In the spring they will consider whether Capitol rioters (and by implication, the man they were rioting for) can be charged under a federal law that criminalises corruptly obstructing an official proceeding. And in the coming weeks they may be asked to resolve whether ex-presidents enjoy “absolute immunity” from criminal prosecution for things they did in office—a question at the heart of the January 6th case that Jack Smith, the special counsel, is prosecuting.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Chief Justice Roberts may try to broker big majorities for a path through the minefield: keeping Mr Trump on the ballot while rejecting his claim to blanket immunity.

In head-to-head polls he leads Joe Biden by 2.3 points on average. That suggests a toss-up. Polls conducted so far in advance of the election have generally missed by a margin far greater than Mr Trump’s current lead.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">And Mr Trump’s voters vex pollsters: they appear to be disproportionately less likely to take part in pre-election surveys yet turn out to vote for him. Pollsters have been grappling with ways to reflect this in their numbers, but no one knows how well their adjustments will work. In a close contest, even small errors can prove critical.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Polling looks simpler than it is. To gauge what people think, pollsters ask questions of a tiny subset of a population. But some people—generally those who are older, whiter and have college degrees—are more likely to respond than others. To make the sample better reflect the population as a whole, pollsters have two levers they can fiddle with. They can adjust how they select their sample or they can place more weight on the views of those underrepresented within it. Most do both.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">To complicate matters further, election prognosticators also have to predict who will actually vote. Pollsters filter out those they predict are unlikely to show up. Although they have various tools to do this—from voter-registration data to respondents’ stated intentions—it remains as much an art as a science.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In 2016 the size and composition of the electorate surprised pollsters. The national polls had accurately predicted Hillary Clinton’s margin in the popular vote. But at the state level polls failed miserably. Turnout surged in Republican counties in swing states across the Midwest. And it was precisely those voters—mostly white and without college degrees—that pollsters had missed because they were less likely to take part in their surveys. The white respondents who did pick up their phone calls were more likely to have college degrees and to support Mrs Clinton than the electorate was as a whole.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Polls that had accounted for respondents’ education level were more accurate. Some 52% of national polls had done so, which helps explain why the national polls erred by far less than state polls did in 2016 (see chart). In crucial states such as Michigan, by contrast, only one in five polls adjusted for education. So in the aftermath of that election most pollsters began ensuring their samples better reflected Americans’ education levels and thus captured the widening partisan gap between those with and without college degrees. This seemed to work in the 2018 midterms: polls were more accurate than they had been in the previous five midterm cycles.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="626" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20230106_USC825.png" srcset="../image/20230106_USC825.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But then, in 2020, came another polling meltdown. In gauging the national popular vote, pollsters had their largest miss in 40 years. And their errors were no longer concentrated in the Rust Belt but rather rippled across the country. Whereas pollsters had, on average, expected Mr Biden to win with an 8.4-point margin in the popular vote, his edge turned out to be about half that. The American Association for Public Opinion Research assembled a task force of academics and pollsters to conduct an autopsy. Their findings are not reassuring: “identifying conclusively” why the polls erred, they reckoned, “appears to be impossible with the available data”.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">One theory is that some of Mr Trump’s supporters—who are unusually sceptical of institutions like the federal government and the media—may have heeded his calls to not trust pollsters. (He has recently been at it again, calling a New Hampshire poll that showed Nikki Haley trailing behind him by a mere four percentage points “just another scam”.) If enough of his backers ignored pollsters yet turned out to vote for him, estimates of the size and preferences of the electorate would be skewed. This puts pollsters in a bind: unlike demographic variables that they can adjust for, like age, sex or educational attainment, there is no objective measure of “institutional trust”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Some have tried creative workarounds. Wick Insights, a polling firm, realised that respondents who were vaccinated against covid-19 took part in its polls disproportionately often. To adjust for this, it placed more weight on the views of unvaccinated respondents. But in 2022 its polls far overstated Republican support.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Technology has also changed the game. Nearly every American used to have a home phone, and pollsters could randomly dial a number of households to obtain a sufficiently representative sample of the country. But with the advent of cell phones and caller-<small>ID</small>, response rates plummeted, from 36% in 1997 to 6% in 2018.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Use of online polling has soared in recent years. In 2016 38% of polls were conducted online. By 2020 that number had swelled to 64%. They are cheaper than live-caller polls, but bring their own challenges. Rather than reaching out to a random sample of the population, online pollsters rely on respondents opting in. Doug Rivers, the chief scientist at YouGov, an online pollster partners with, notes that, whereas phone surveys have low response rates, online pollsters can’t be sure whether “the people we are getting [to respond] are unusual in some way that we don’t understand”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">One answer is to use a patchwork of survey methods—online, text, telephone, postal—to stitch together a fuller picture of the electorate. “As reaching people on the phone gets harder, mail is actually still a way to reach a broad swathe of the population,” says Chris Jackson, a researcher at Ipsos, a polling firm. Pollsters are also increasingly relying on voter rolls, databases of all registered voters. After 2020 the /Siena College poll started using these to identify people whose demographic data or voting history suggest they are unusually averse to speaking with pollsters. Extra efforts can then go into including them in polling samples.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Such innovations seemed to pay off in the 2022 midterms. The average polling error was the lowest since at least 1998. But whether this success can be repeated in a general election with Mr Trump on the ballot is unclear. Mr Trump seems to animate two parts of the electorate: highly engaged Democrats who loathe him and turn out to vote against him and his party, and a historically less engaged set who turn out to vote for him but maybe not for his party.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0"> Polls, not prophecy</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">So how should the polls be read? Even pollsters urge caution. Josh Clinton, who co-directs the Vanderbilt poll, says that “in some sense, it’s background noise”. At this stage, he notes, “it’s nearly impossible to know what’s going on”. He points to the narrow margins between Messrs Biden and Trump and the unresolved issues from 2020. Others are upbeat. “I think the state of polling is vibrant right now,” says Don Levy, the director of polling at Siena College, “and the consumer of polls has a lot to look at.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The discerning consumer would do well to keep a few things in mind. First, it is better to follow polling averages than any single poll. Second, it makes sense to focus above all on polls in the swing states that will determine the outcome in the electoral college, and thus who wins the presidency. Lastly, the election will almost certainly be close. Polls that show a large lead for either candidate are probably outliers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">After falling short in 2016 and 2020 pollsters are wise to underpromise and hope to overdeliver. The candidates will not be the only ones facing judgment in 2024. The polling industry will be, too. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/united-states/"><span>United States</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->The Gay divorce</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">The decline and fall of Harvard’s president</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Claudine Gay’s sloppy citations added to the embarrassment of her recent congressional testimony</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_USP502.jpg" width="auto"/><div class="css-1y6lujj ee5d8yd0"><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">W</span><small>hen it comes</small> to scandals, the drip-drip-drip kind can prove deadly.

But more kept surfacing. The latest allegations, published on January 1st in the , a conservative outlet, brought the total to several dozen. The next day she resigned, a mere six months into her post—the shortest tenure in Harvard’s history. She determined that this was in the university’s best interests. Harvard’s provost, Alan Garber, will fill the job on an interim basis.</p><p class="article__body-text">Plagiarism did for Ms Gay, a political scientist by training. But the pressure on her to step down began with her response to Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7th. Critics—Harvard donors, professors, politicians—assailed her for not immediately condemning the violence and not disavowing a statement by pro-Palestinian students that blamed Israel. Larry Summers, a former president of Harvard, said he had “never been as disillusioned and alienated” with the university. A few days later Elise Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman, called on Ms Gay to resign.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Then, in early December, came her dismal performance at a <a href="/united-states/2023/12/12/american-universities-face-a-reckoning-over-antisemitism">congressional hearing about antisemitism on campus</a>. Questioned by Ms Stefanik, she and two other university leaders refused to say that calling for the genocide of Jews would be punished at their schools. Amid the blowback, the president of the University of Pennsylvania resigned. Harvard’s faculty rallied behind Ms Gay and urged the board to back her. Point-scoring Republicans and meddlesome donors should butt out, went the feeling. It rankled that some critics had in effect called Ms Gay, Harvard’s first black leader, a diversity hire.</p><p class="article__body-text">But then came the plagiarism accusations. On December 10th Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist, accused Ms Gay of lifting phrases from other scholars’ work in her dissertation without quotation marks. Two days later Harvard’s board acknowledged that it had been notified of separate allegations in late October. An independent review of her work had uncovered “a few instances of inadequate citation”, said the board, resulting in corrections to two articles. </p><p class="article__body-text">Still more accusations followed, filed in two anonymous complaints with the university and published by the . About half of Ms Gay’s 11 journal articles—a thin body of scholarship compared with that of her predecessors—were said to contain lifted lines, or to lack attribution.</p><p class="article__body-text">None of Ms Gay’s transgressions alone appears all that egregious—nothing like, for example, the data fabricated in the lab led by Marc Tessier-Lavigne, a neuroscientist who resigned as president of Stanford University in July. (Stanford’s board determined that he was unaware of the falsification.) But any Harvard student who copies others’ work without citing it, as Ms Gay appears to have done, would incur penalties ranging from academic probation to expulsion.

Ms Gay was evidently coached for her disastrous congressional testimony by lawyers with zero media-savvy. </p><p class="article__body-text">They also need to be better vetted.

Every once in a while, however, one catches fire. In 2015 Anne Case and Angus Deaton, two Princeton University economists, published a landmark study showing that from the late 1990s the mortality rate of white middle-aged Americans had started to rise after decades of decline—owing to a surge in alcohol-related deaths, fatal drug overdoses and suicides. This “deaths-from-despair” mortality rate has not slowed since: in 2022 more than 200,000 people died from alcohol, drugs or suicide, equivalent to a Boeing 747 falling out of the sky every day with no survivors. Yet even as America’s deaths-of-despair epidemic has intensified, its causes have grown harder to identify.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">When Ms Case and Mr Deaton put forward their thesis, their focus was on middle-aged white Americans without university degrees. For decades this group had been able to make a living with no more than a high-school diploma. But they were now suffering from stagnant wages and shrinking job opportunities. That, in turn, had contributed to an erosion of traditional social institutions, such as marriage and religion. Although black and Hispanic Americans had been affected by many of the same economic forces, it was whites that were left with particular feelings of despair and meaninglessness. The result was drug abuse and suicide, aided by exploitative pharmaceutical companies and inept regulators.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This story appealed to many pundits, in part because it seemed to explain political trends. In the 2016 presidential election rust-belt states with a high concentration of white working-class people voted disproportionately for Donald Trump. Places where life expectancy had fallen most experienced the biggest swing towards the Republican candidate. The Case-Deaton theory seemed to explain why Americans in such “left-behind” communities were so receptive to Mr Trump’s bomb-throwing rhetoric and his promises to restore the American dream for the country’s forgotten.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Many economists, however, were not convinced. Some criticised the researchers’ methodology. By adjusting for inflation using the <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/01/15/incomes-are-rising-in-america-especially-for-the-poorest">consumer-price index</a> rather than the personal-consumption-expenditures index, for example, the duo overestimated the decline in white working-class wages. By comparing people with and without college degrees, they obscured the fact that much of the increase in mortality was concentrated in high-school dropouts, a small and shrinking segment of the population. And some researchers thought that the survey data on which the economists relied to illustrate growing mental distress was inadequate to explain the rising death toll.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Others argued that the deaths-of-despair phenomenon was better explained by supply-side factors. In 2010 Purdue Pharma, a drug company, reformulated OxyContin, its signature prescription opioid. The new “abuse-deterrent” version, unlike the original one, could not be crushed and snorted to deliver an immediate high. This prompted some addicts to switch to heroin, leading to more overdoses. When fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, entered widespread use from the early 2010s, deaths were highest in places with the greatest access to the drug. <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/07/at-last-a-convincing-explanation-for-americas-drug-death-crisis">A recent working paper</a> shows that between 2008 and 2020 states with more imports—fentanyl is often smuggled from abroad, hidden in legitimate shipments—suffered from more fentanyl overdoses.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>New kids on the block</b></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">As explanations for the causes of the deaths have evolved, so have theories about the populations most vulnerable to it. The Case-Deaton thesis centred on working-class whites. But an analysis of mortality and demographic data by  shows that the devastation has spread beyond predominantly white cities such as Huntington, in West Virginia, to more diverse places like Baltimore, New Orleans and St Louis (see map).</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="1120" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_USC903.png" srcset="../image/20240106_USC903.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">2010 marked a turning-point. Between 1999 and 2010 counties with the highest share of working-class whites saw deaths of despair grow much faster than in the counties with the lowest. Between 2010 and 2022, though (a period that covers Mr Trump’s election), that relationship flipped (see chart). Deaths of despair rose by 5.5% per year in counties with lots of high-school-educated whites, but by 7% in the most diverse, educated ones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A decade ago the mortality rate from alcohol, drugs and suicide was nearly one-fifth higher in conservative counties than in liberal ones. Today, deaths from despair are now as prevalent in Democratic parts of the country as in Republican ones. And because left-leaning counties tend to be bigger than conservative ones, they record 10,000 more deaths of despair per year than them.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Indeed, the despair that Ms Case and Mr Deaton wrote about can now be found among nearly every demographic group. Black Americans are <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/04/09/black-americans-have-overtaken-white-victims-in-opioid-death-rates">more likely</a> to die from drug overdoses than whites. <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/12/03/young-americans-increasingly-end-their-own-lives">Young people</a> are taking their own lives at ever-higher rates. Perhaps most overlooked are Native Americans, for whom the deaths-of-despair mortality rate is at least one-and-a-half times that of white Americans, and rising. Our data show that such deaths are more than three times as common in the 35 counties where Native Americans make up the largest share of the population than they are in the rest of the country.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="626" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_USC702.png" srcset="../image/20240106_USC702.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">What does this mean for the nearly decade-old theory of deaths of despair? “We were very optimistic about African-Americans in the first paper—there had been no upsurge in deaths for them until two years after we first wrote it,” says Mr Deaton. “The facts on the ground have changed.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">So must the analysis. In 2010 suicides barely outpaced overdoses, and alcohol deaths lagged just behind. That justified thinking about the three causes of death together. Today, however, there are more deaths from overdoses than from the other two causes combined (see chart).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This now looks more like a medical crisis than a social one. And if the lethality of new drugs is even partly to blame, America is in trouble: dealers have started lacing fentanyl with “<a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/08/17/how-dangerous-is-tranq-the-new-drug-sweeping-america">tranq</a>”, a horse sedative that causes flesh wounds, and nitazenes, a Chinese-made opioid more than 40 times as potent as fentanyl.

Early in the new act, Mr Chappelle says with a grin, “I love punching down.” That is ostensibly a reference to a marginalised group he is newly mocking, people with disabilities. But it registers also as a shot at the offended multitude that   tried in 2021 to get Netflix to remove his show that year, “The Closer”, because of his jokes about transgender and gay people. It was among the biggest of the many uproars thus far over where to draw the boundaries for American discourse, and it was also unusual because Netflix held the line in the face of an internal uprising as well as a social-media assault.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The company’s co-chief executive, Ted Sarandos, told its employees at the time that Netflix would host shows they might not like. “There are going to be things that you might feel are harmful,” he warned. “But we are trying to entertain a world with varying tastes and varying sensibilities and various beliefs.” Whether the leaders of Netflix took their stand out of principle or commercial interest—most likely, some unknowable mix of the two—they were right on both counts.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For his part, while Mr Chappelle may not have won the culture war, having overcome his adversaries he is relishing the rout.

But as Mr Chappelle attacks this era’s cant and self-certainty, the punchlines can suggest that he, and America, remain a bit stuck. “You see, it’s a funny thing if you believe you’re absolutely right,” he observes near the end of the show. “You can get drunk off the feeling of how right you are.” Then he sticks in the now-familiar barb: “That’s why gay people are so mean.” The attacks on Mr Chappelle’s work only strengthened him, but in repeatedly picking the same fight, he is granting his adversaries some continued power, too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In 2022 an audience member with a knife charged at Mr Chappelle while he was performing at the Hollywood Bowl. The assailant later said the jokes were “triggering” him. Mr Chappelle, who was not injured, has turned the attack into one of his best bits. It reverses his usual pattern:  the routine starts out poking at bisexuality, but then leaves that subject behind to wend towards first poignant, then hilarious punchlines about the inheritance he has squirrelled away in a safe-deposit box for his family. Maybe, when Mr Chappelle’s whole act can follow that sort of pattern, the culture wars will truly be ending.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">An American fraud</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A fine new film, “American Fiction”, transcends all this bickering. Thelonious Ellison, known as Monk, is a black academic and author whose erudite novels do not sell well. Enraged by the success of a novel he sees as black-poverty porn (its title: “We’s Lives in Da Ghetto”), Monk, under a pseudonym, bats out a parody of such work (“My Pafology”), only to have it rapturously embraced by white literary types who consider themselves progressive. This broad conceit about racial tropes occasions many more subtle observations of bigotry and hypocrisy, as when a white film director inflated with self-regard over his sensitivity to anti-black cruelty casually humiliates an Asian-American assistant.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But the film’s most powerful message is that, to be compelling to a broad audience, it should not need to indulge in the conceit about racial tropes at all.  Race recedes from the story’s real comedy and pathos, which lie in Monk’s relationships with his equally bruised, witty and accomplished siblings and with his aristocratic mother, who is fading into Alzheimer’s. “You know, I don’t really believe in race,” Monk says plaintively at one point. The problem, as his agent notes, is that pretty much everyone else does believe in that most poisonous of American fictions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Like Mr Chappelle, “American Fiction” argues that people deserve respect not just because of their identification with any broad group but because of their intricacies, because of their facets and flaws as individuals. Politics, with its traffic in demographic voting blocs, has never had much patience for such microscopic focus or even such universal themes. That is why the culture needs to supply them. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Read more from Lexington, our columnist on American politics: <br/></b></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/the-americas/"><span>The Americas</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Until forever, failing</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Cuba’s private-sector experiment is faltering</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Mostly because it is not bold enough</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_AMP001.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>t was an</small> admission of sorts. When Manuel Marrero Cruz, Cuba’s prime minister, stood in front of the National Assembly in late December to announce a package of new economic measures, he first blamed the American embargo for the woeful state of the country’s economy. But then he added: “We could have done much more.” That is an understatement.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/07/06/cubas-communist-government-taps-the-diaspora-for-cash">Cuba’s economy</a> is in its worst state since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s. Even the official figures—which one Western businessman in Havana, the capital, describes as “an exercise in a cover-up”—make grim reading. Annual inflation, according to the government, is at 30%. The fiscal deficit is forecast to be at least 18% of <small>GDP</small> in 2024. In 2023 the economy contracted by around 2%, according to Alejandro Gil, the economy minister.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Unable to take part in a democratic election, many Cubans are voting with their feet. Migration from the island is at its highest level since the revolution in 1959, reports the Washington Office on Latin America, an advocacy group. During the fiscal years of 2022 and 2023 some 425,000 Cuban migrants went to the United States and 36,000 submitted asylum applications in Mexico. That is more than 4% of the population. Many have left for other destinations, including Russia, where detailed migration figures are not published. At the start of the school term in September, Cuban schools were missing 17,000 teachers, according to the ministry of education.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Some of Cuba’s problems have been exacerbated by recent events. During Donald Trump’s tenure as president of the United States, sanctions on the island were tightened. Cuba was also added to a list of state sponsors of terrorism. Meanwhile tourism, which accounted for 11% of <small>GDP</small> in 2019, has not recovered from the pandemic. In 2023 the number of visitors was barely 2m, though the government had hoped for 3.5m. Last year Venezuela reduced its shipments of crude oil to the island, as it was struggling to process enough for its own needs. That caused Cuba’s government to impose rationing and warn of blackouts. (Shipments rebounded in September, before being cut again in November, after American sanctions on Venezuela’s state oil company were lifted.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But the biggest problem is the enduring reluctance of Cuba’s rulers to allow the private sector to thrive. Much has changed in the country since Fidel Castro, the revolutionary leader, declared in 1968 that “there will be no future in this nation for private business or the self-employed”. Raúl Castro, Fidel’s brother and successor, who formally took over the presidency in 2008, moved to end certain pretences such as the idea that Cubans would rather swap their houses than sell them. A modest housing market now exists.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Since 2018 under Miguel Díaz-Canel, the current president, private enterprise has been steadily extended, too. In 2021 Cubans, previously restricted to being sole traders, were permitted to become entrepreneurs and run small- and medium-size enterprises (with up to 100 employees). There are now 10,000 of these <small>SME</small>s, accounting for fully 14% of <small>GDP</small>. They fill the gaps where the inefficient state has failed. Delivery companies which import food are one example. “It’s all easier here now, if you have money. I order everything online,” says one Havana-based expatriate as he displays his well-stocked freezer, crammed with American frozen food.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It was clear from the meeting of the National Assembly in December, however, that any further attempts to open up the economy to the free market would be resisted by the regime’s elderly top brass, many of whom were schooled by Castro. “We are stuck. We need to increase production!” Esteban Lazo, the 79-year-old president of the Assembly, blurted out in despair during one meeting.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Lazo complains about the symptom, but not the cause. It is he and his cohort who have prevented some of the basic reforms which the country desperately needs. This is particularly notable in the agricultural sector. Farmers cannot import their own equipment or sell most of their produce directly to consumers; instead they have to go through the state. But the government is useless at getting fuel and parts to farmers. Cuban agricultural production fell by 35% between 2019 and 2023, according to official figures.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Another example of old-fashioned thinking concerns the exchange rate. Cuba’s two-currency system was scrapped in 2021. But there are still official fixed rates of 24 Cuban pesos per <small>US</small> dollar for state enterprises and 120 to the dollar for individuals. The black-market rate, however, is more than 270 pesos for each dollar.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The mismatch causes a series of distortions, most of which favour the rich. Petrol is priced at 30 pesos a litre, which at the black-market rate is equivalent to about ten <small>US</small> cents per litre. That is cheaper than in Kuwait, where petrol is heavily subsidised. Opulent early-20th-century mansions, confiscated from the “bourgeoisie” by the state after the revolution in 1959, can be rented from a government-owned estate agent in Havana for around $300 a month if you pay in pesos, in cash and know the right people.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Yet instead of accepting that its official rate is out of kilter, the government blames the messenger. At the assembly meeting Mr Marrero, the prime minister, accused foreign websites, which track the street exchange rate, of publishing what he said were “fictitious” rates. The data-publishers are “enemies” of the revolution, he said.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">There are some reformers in government. Mr Díaz-Canel is believed to be more sympathetic to private business than his elderly colleagues. On December 29th he said the state was not embarking on a “crusade” against the private sector, but warned that it would not be allowed to become an anti-revolutionary faction either. The message was that political loyalty still remains a prerequisite for running a business in Cuba. Mr Gil, the economy minister, is also viewed as a cautious reformer.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Some changes were announced at the meeting last month, including an unspecified rise in the price of petrol and a 25% rise in electricity prices for heavy consumers this year. Although that is a move in the right direction, it will hit private businesses, most of which have so far enjoyed almost free electricity. There is also a plan to phase out subsidised staples, such as rice or sugar, and instead provide direct benefits to poorer people. Mr Díaz-Canel said the measures “will give a necessary jolt to the economy”. He added: “We will make more revolution and more socialism.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In practice, that seems unlikely. More probable is that a manipulated private sector and artificial exchange rate will benefit a few well-placed insiders, while small tweaks to a rotten system will not be enough to stem Cuba’s decline. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/the-americas/"><span>The Americas</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Hacker heaven</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Why is Brazil a hotspot for financial crime?</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Its success as a fintech hub is mostly to blame</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_AMP002.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">B</span><small>razillians have</small> long been early adopters of fintech. In 2017 <small>EY</small>, an accounting firm, found that two-fifths of Brazilians regularly used online banking, one of the highest rates worldwide. In 2020 44% of customers had a digital-only account, compared with less than 20% in the United States and Canada, according to a survey by Accenture, a consulting firm. That year the central bank released Pix, an instant-payments platform. It has been wildly successful. Today it has 3bn transactions a month. That is five times more than transactions by debit and credit cards combined.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This bonanza has attracted cyber-criminals. Their main weapon has been the “banking trojan”, a programme that steals users’ account information. According to Kaspersky Lab, a cyber-security firm, Brazil is the top country for attacks by banking trojans, with 1.8m attempted infections from June 2022 to July 2023 (the latest data available). Globally eight of the 13 most popular types of trojans are made in Brazil.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Cyber-criminals initially focused on trojans as they require little skill to use. However, as banks developed better defences, criminals were forced to branch out into more complex and lucrative attacks. Brazil’s underworld has developed the most advanced “point of sale” malware, which scammers use to filch bank details from card readers, according to Kaspersky Lab. Known as Prilex, this application can block contactless payments by stopping the short-range connection between a credit card and the payment terminal. The terminal reads: “Error. Please Insert.” When a customer inserts her card and <small>PIN</small>, the malware uses the credentials to authorise a fraudulent transaction. During Rio’s carnival in 2016, a hacker used a basic version of this software to remotely take over 1,000 <small>ATM</small>s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Another example is ransomware, which gangs use to scramble computers and demand money to restore them. In October last year Brazil’s lawmakers met to discuss the increasing use of artificial intelligence in cyber-crime, too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The financial losses are big. According to Andre Fleury of Accenture, Brazil is in the top five countries for the cost of cyber-crime. He estimates the figure is around $20bn per year. That is the equivalent of 0.9% of <small>GDP</small>. There is some hope, though. In 2022 a hefty data-protection law came into effect, forcing companies to defend consumers’ data. In 2023 Brazil’s banks spent $9bn on cyber-security, nearly double the amount in 2019, according to the Brazilian Federation of Banks. The bigger problem is naive customers who fall for scams, says Eduardo Mônaco of ClearSale, a Brazilian fraud-management company. Until they fully know the risks, there will be plenty more phish in the sea. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/asia/"><span>Asia</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Turning unPacific?</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">America braces for Taiwan’s election—and vice versa</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Presidential races in both places may worsen tensions with China</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_ASP001.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>he year</small> 2022 brought the war in Ukraine; 2023 the one in Gaza.

But American officials have long fretted that a victory for <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2024/01/04/for-china-taiwans-elections-are-a-looming-crisis">Lai Ching-te</a>, deputy to President Tsai Ing-wen and fellow member of the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party (<small>dpp</small>), could lead to escalation.

Mr Lai, for his part, once described himself as a “pragmatic worker for Taiwan independence”. Of late, though, he has emphasised the fudgy status quo. He says Taiwan is “already a sovereign country” and thus has no need to declare independence. That position still infuriates the mainland, and Mr Lai’s election could quickly be met with intensified Chinese economic or military pressure.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">America has a history of tense dealings with the <small>dPP</small>. Of late relations have improved owing to Ms Tsai’s  caution and increased bullying by China—not least a missile barrage in 2022, almost blockading Taiwan, after it was visited by Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of America’s House of Representatives. Still, American officials worry about Mr Lai’s proclivity for loose language, including a remark about hoping to “enter the White House” as Taiwan’s president, which would break with precedent.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">All of which might suggest that a win for Mr Lai’s nearest rival, Hou Yu-ih of the Kuomintang (<small>kmt</small>), could reduce tensions. The former mayor of New Taipei City (the exurbs of Taiwan’s capital) is preferred  in Beijing. The nationalist <small>kmt</small> is the Chinese Communist Party’s old enemy: its leaders fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war in 1949. But it at least shares the party’s belief in one China (even if the <small>kmt</small> wants a democratic one). Mr Hou accuses the <small>dpp</small> of endangering Taiwan by flirting with independence and promises to bring peace through dialogue with China.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Yet Mr Hou might not bring greater calm. He opposes both independence and China’s offer of unification under a “one country, two systems” arrangement. Most Taiwanese reject that model, which failed to protect Hong Kong’s former freedoms. Mere dialogue will not satisfy Mr Xi, who will want concessions that Mr Hou cannot deliver, like progress towards unification. A foot-dragging Mr Hou could prove as irksome to Mr Xi as Mr Lai.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A second danger, in American eyes, is that Mr Hou might curb the push for a more asymmetric strategy, ie, using lots of mobile defensive weapons to turn the island into a “porcupine”. The <small>dpp</small> has hiked defence spending and extended conscription. Mr Hou tells American interlocutors he values deterrence, but says Taiwan can save on defence and shorten conscription by improving ties with China.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Were he to prove more overtly pro-China, Mr Hou might irk America. Evan Medeiros, a former China hand at the White House, notes a “background debate” about America’s one-China policy. The United States would in theory be content to see the unification of Taiwan with the mainland if done peacefully. In practice these days it is wedded to the status quo. Pentagon officials see the “<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/15/how-the-pentagon-thinks-about-americas-strategy-in-the-pacific">first island chain</a>”, running from Japan through Taiwan to Indonesia, as “America’s forward defence perimeter in the western Pacific”, in the words of one.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Whoever wins the presidency may be constrained by a hostile or hung Yuan, Taiwan’s parliament. “The question is less whether the new president will enact a radical change in the status quo. The question is more: how will an untested leader deal with a change in the status quo due to exogenous factors?” says Jude Blanchette of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, another American think-tank. What would happen if Taiwan overreacted to Chinese military probing; or if there were a clash during an encounter between American and Chinese forces?</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="740" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_ASM901.png" srcset="../image/20240106_ASM901.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">America’s elections could also unsettle things in several ways. One is that Mr Biden, burdened by wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and by his re-election campaign, could yield to Chinese pressure on Taiwan despite his repeated vows to defend the island. Another is that, during a fevered presidential race in which standing up to China becomes a virility test, Mr Biden overreacts or hawks in Congress stage a provocation akin to Ms Pelosi’s trip.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">As for Donald Trump, Mr Biden’s likely Republican challenger, he has long been contemptuous of America’s alliances, and has accused Taiwan of stealing America’s semiconductor industry. In his first term he told aides he would not defend the island. Yet it is also possible that his future aides might push to confront China more forcefully, using Taiwan as leverage. Many in Congress want to give Taiwan greater support and diplomatic recognition.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For now, isolationism is paralysing American policy. Republicans in Congress are holding up a supplemental budget to help friends and allies—including support for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan’s military defences. In exchange, they want measures to curb migration across America’s southern border. The budget bill also includes funds for American submarine yards to facilitate the <small>aukus</small> deal, under which America and Britain would supply nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. Congress has also delayed a full defence appropriations bill for fiscal year 2024, hampering the Pentagon’s efforts to prepare for possible conflict with China. Mr Trump may or may not return to power. But Trumpism is already undermining Taiwan and other Indo-Pacific allies. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/asia/"><span>Asia</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Going for the jugular</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Lee Jae-myung, South Korea’s opposition leader, survives a stabbing</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">The motive for the attack is unclear</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_ASP003.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">W</span><small>ith a parliamentary </small>election due in April, <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/28/south-koreas-opposition-leader-narrowly-avoids-arrest">Lee Jae-myung</a> was quick to start campaigning in the New Year.

An American ambassador, Mark Lippert, needed 80 stitches to his face and hand after being attacked by a North Korean sympathiser in 2015. In 2006 Park Geun-hye, later South Korea’s president, was gashed with a Stanley knife.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The latest violence comes at an especially ugly time in South Korean politics. The most recent presidential election, in which Yoon Suk-yeol beat Mr Lee by 0.7% of the vote, was notable for mudslinging. It has deepened partisan animosity. Yet what motivated Mr Lee’s attacker, identified by the police as a 66-year-old man named “Kim”, is unclear.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">He had purported to be a fan of Mr Lee. He carried a sign reading “200 [<small>DP</small>] seats at the National Assembly”, more than the party has now. On his crown was written, “I am Lee Jae-myung”, a slogan used by diehard fans of the politician. Still, his intention was clear. After his arrest he told police: “I tried to kill him.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The feuding parties have vowed to dial it down. Mr Yoon and others in his People Power Party (<small>PPP</small>) expressed concern for Mr Lee. Hong Joon-pyo, a combative <small>ppp</small> veteran, called for an end to the “gladiatorial politics of us hating and killing each other”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">If this leads to even a modest sympathy vote for Mr Lee, it would be invaluable for the<small> DP, </small>which is tied in polling with its rival. If the opposition party can preserve its parliamentary majority in April, it could block Mr Yoon’s policy agenda until he leaves office in 2027.<span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/asia/"><span>Asia</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Off to a dire start </span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">A major earthquake in Japan highlights the country’s resilience</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">At least 78 were killed.

At around 4:10pm on January 1st a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the Noto peninsula on the northern side of Honshu, the country’s main island, killing at least 78 people. The earth shook even in Tokyo, some 300km (185 miles) away. The following day a Japan Airlines flight burst into flames after landing at Tokyo’s Haneda airport and colliding with a Japan Coast Guard plane that entered the same runway while on a mission to deliver supplies to the earthquake disaster zone. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The disasters proved less catastrophic than was feared. In the wake of the quake, officials warned of an impending tsunami with five-metre waves. Broadcasters urged residents to evacuate, evoking a tremor in 2011 that triggered a vast tsunami and a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. Yet the major tsunami did not materialise; the highest waves reached 1.2m in Wajima port, near the epicentre. Though dire, the death toll is far from the roughly 20,000 people killed in 2011. Several nuclear plants are located near Noto but none experienced operational abnormalities, according to the Nuclear Regulation Authority, a body set up after Fukushima’s meltdown.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="627" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_ASM900.png" srcset="../image/20240106_ASM900.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Dramatic video footage of the burning Japan Airlines plane spread on social media. The images made the chances of survival for passengers look slim. In the event, five of the six crew members on the coastguard flight were killed. But all 379 people aboard the civil aircraft made it out alive.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The earthquake still caused severe damage. The recovery will be protracted. Some 97,000 people were initially ordered to evacuate their homes. More than 30,000 households lost power; water service ceased in dozens of towns and villages.  Bullet-train service was halted. The runway at Noto’s main airport cracked. Many roads collapsed, complicating evacuation and rescue efforts. In light of the suffering this caused, Japan’s emperor and empress cancelled their traditional New Year appearance, planned for January 2nd.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Japan sits in one of the world’s most seismically active areas. <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/31/japan-is-preparing-for-a-massive-earthquake">Major earthquakes</a> have occurred regularly throughout its history, often causing political aftershocks. In 1923 a magnitude-7.9 quake struck near Tokyo, triggering a disaster in which at least 105,000 perished. The tragedy prompted the government to introduce seismic building codes and to support extensive research into plate tectonics.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Japan is still dealing with <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/03/06/the-fukushima-disaster-was-not-the-turning-point-many-had-hoped">the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011</a>, in particular the Fukushima meltdown, which led to the temporary closure of its nuclear plants. The current government has been pushing to revive nuclear power, and public opposition has softened in recent years. But each subsequent quake is a reminder that seismic risk is ever-present.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Yet the earthquake in Noto also shows how resilience can be cultivated. The destruction would probably have been much worse were it not for Japan’s attention to disaster risk. The country invests heavily in prevention measures. Early-warning systems beam messages about big quakes to mobile phones and television screens; one alert for an aftershock on January 1st interrupted a live broadcast of an appearance by the prime minister. Local governments and businesses plan and train rigorously for disasters. Ishikawa prefecture, which includes the Noto peninsula, created a “Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters” almost as soon as the disaster hit. <small>JR</small> East, which operates trains in the regions closest to the quake, had its bullet-train lines running again by 3pm on January 2nd—less than 24 hours after the quake.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Similarly, those aboard the Japan Airlines flight survived largely thanks to thorough preparation and calm execution. The carrier is known as an industry leader in safety culture. Despite flames licking at the plane’s windows and smoke filling its cabin, a well-trained crew evacuated all 367 passengers, including eight infants, within 18 minutes. Flight attendants implored passengers to keep calm while they identified three safe exits and employed backup megaphones to communicate when the in-flight announcement system failed. Passengers in turn seem to have followed instructions not to take luggage during their escape. Together they slid to safety, turning a potential tragedy into an object lesson.<span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/asia/"><span>Asia</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Powering down</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">The energy transition could make India even more unequal</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Rich Indian states are sunny and windy, while poor ones have lots of coal</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_ASP503.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>NDIA’s energy </small>transition is well under way.

The government of Narendra Modi has set a target of generating 500<small>GW</small> from renewable sources, or half the projected total capacity, by 2030.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But coal will remain an important part of the mix. According to a study by<small> Niti</small> Aayog, a government think-tank, demand for it will not peak until 2035-2040. That helps explain why India has given itself until 2070 to hit net-zero emissions. This should provide latitude to develop its economy—and also give the regions most reliant on fossil fuels time to adjust.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">India’s mineral riches are largely in its eastern and central states. These are among its poorest places. Without proper planning, dwindling coal revenues could throw their economies into disarray. Neither can they rely on much investment in renewables. In a cruel quirk of geography, six of the eight Indian states that receive the most sunshine and wind are in the prosperous south and west.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Consider Jharkhand. It is India’s biggest coal-producing state, with 28% of proven reserves. It is also grindingly poor: 28% of its people are classified as living in extreme poverty, the second-highest rate of any state. Mining is a big chunk of its economy, accounting for 78% of non-tax revenues. Of its 24 districts, 18 produce coal or host coal-dependent industries.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Yet of India’s 1050<small>GW</small> wind-and-solar potential, Jharkhand accounts for just 18<small>GW</small>, or 1.7%. By contrast, four states in south India and two in its west, along with Madhya Pradesh in the middle and the desert state of Rajasthan in the north-west, account for two-thirds. “The power vector will change from [flowing] east to west or centre to south to the reverse…It is inevitable,” says Sutirtha Bhattacharya, a former chairman of Coal India, a state-owned firm that is the world’s biggest coal producer.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">India’s energy economy is already shifting. Nearly 75% of the country’s installed solar and wind generation capacity in 2020 was in the six southern and western states. Less than 5% was in ten northern, eastern and central states, excluding Madhya Pradesh. Though coal production and consumption are still growing, coal’s share in the electricity-generation mix declined from 57% to 48% in the five years to last November. States such as Jharkhand face a prospect of having to buy energy from other states, even as their revenues from coal decrease. Their fiscal deficits are likely to balloon, according to a working paper by Rohit Chandra and Sanjay Mitra for the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a research institution in Delhi.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Jharkhand, the state that will be hardest-hit, is already thinking ahead. In late 2022 it set up a task-force to plan for what it calls a “just transition”. “We were considered to be blessed because we have so much coal. Today people are saying it’s a curse,” says Ajay Kumar Rastogi, the task-force’s chairman. “But we see it as an opportunity for the state to plan.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The task-force is charged with devising policies to help exploit whatever solar potential Jharkhand has, perhaps on disused coalfields, and to incentivise green industries such as hydrogen. It is also working to ensure its policies are implemented by the state’s bureaucracy. This is an example to other affected states. Chhattisgarh, a similar case, is said to be considering setting up a task-force of its own.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Limiting the negative fallout of the energy transition will be important not just for such states, but also for regions that stand to benefit and for India overall. As part of its federal compact, richer states help fund poorer ones by paying more into central government coffers than they draw out. If Jharkhand and its peers grow poorer, southern and western states will find themselves footing a larger bill. So far, write Mr Chandra and Mr Mitra, the “central government ministries have shown little interest” in thinking through, and mitigating, such economic consequences. That needs to change. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/asia/"><span>Asia</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Banyan</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia’s prime minister, is wasting his opportunity</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Having sought the top job for decades, he is making a hash of it</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_ASD001.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>HE MOST</small> enigmatic figure in South-East Asian politics for half a century, Anwar Ibrahim has now served just over a year as Malaysia’s prime minister. Simply holding on to power in that country’s friable politics is a feat. Malaysia’s political parties have in recent years torn themselves apart and prime ministers have come and gone. Mr Anwar, 76, is therefore concentrating on consolidating his ruling coalition. Yet the two questions that loomed over his extraordinary path to power (which included years in jail on politically motivated charges) are now even more salient. What does he stand for? And what will he do with power?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">If Mr Anwar were plain-speaking and consistent, the answers would be obvious. For most of his career,  has been his call sign. He argued for modernising Malaysia’s institutions to render them more democratic and less prone to political interference. He vowed to sever the sleazy nexus of money and politics. He promised a fairer but more productive economy. The political grouping Mr Anwar heads, called Pakatan Harapan (<small>PH)</small>—or Alliance of Hope—is also nominally committed to those goals. It is reformist and multi-ethnic, with support from urban ethnic-Chinese and -Indian minorities as well as liberal Malays. It opposes the racialised politics that for decades saw benefits siphoned to the ethnic-Malay (and Muslim) majority.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But in office the mercurial Mr Anwar has yet to engage in serious policy. He has instead been largely focused on insiderish politicking, with some admittedly impressive results. In the hung Parliament that emerged from the election held in November 2022, it was not Mr Anwar’s own party but a polarising Islamic party, <small>PAS</small>, which had the most seats. Mr Anwar nonetheless trod an unlikely path to power by persuading parties outside <small>PH</small> to beat back <small>PAS</small> and help him form a government. Other parties continue to join his “unity” administration, which now commands a formidable two-thirds of Parliament. On December 12th Mr Anwar shuffled his cabinet for the first time, a move intended to signal strength.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Anthony Loke, the transport minister and an Anwar ally, argues that “with such a strong position in Parliament we should be able to focus on governance, focus on transitioning to major policies and…on developing the economy.” Mr Anwar’s bid to expand his coalition has instead pushed him to unsavoury compromises.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A key backer of the unity government is the rump of the United Malays National Organisation (<small>UMNO</small>), which lorded over post-independence politics until the ouster of the coalition it led, Barisan Nasional, in 2018. Mr Anwar played a part in Barisan’s fall. Today its head, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, is his deputy prime minister. Mr Zahid faced dozens of charges of breach of trust, corruption and money-laundering (which he denied). In September the High Court discharged him after the government chose, with little explanation, not to pursue the case.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Anwar’s embrace of Barisan, an emblem of what ailed Malaysian politics, is not the only thing causing dismay to the would-be reformist’s former supporters. The courts remain prone to political interference. Too much power is centred in the prime minister’s office (Mr Anwar also holds the finance portfolio). And a much-needed law on dark money in politics has not progressed.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Above all, as Bridget Welsh, a scholar of South-East Asia, points out, despite a cross-section of Malaysians lifting him to power, Mr Anwar has done too little to foster tolerance across a polarised society. Indeed Mr Anwar, who began his political career as a young Islamic firebrand, is increasingly pandering to Malay chauvinism and religiosity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Anwar’s people say his desire to remake Malaysia’s institutions is undimmed, but that the nature of his coalition precludes serious progress for now. Though the unity government’s support looks considerable, it is flimsy: if the reform-averse <small>UMNO</small> walked out, other parties would follow. His supporters say his best strategy is to govern decently enough, within the political constraints he faces, to secure a stand-alone Harapan majority at the next election. Then serious reform could begin. In the meantime, Mr Anwar can do things like attract foreign investment.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But the election is not due until 2027. And Mr Anwar’s apparent abandonment of reform has a cost. It is reinforcing Malaysians’ growing disillusion with politics. And how could it not? Their long-promised champion of change right now looks more like an obstacle to it.<span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Read more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia: <br/></b></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/china/"><span>China</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Here be dragons</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Xi Jinping and China face another tough year</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Amid numerous challenges, will the government be able to keep a lid on dissent?</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_CNP003.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">E</span><small>VERY YEAR</small> on December 31st a glimpse of an impenetrable world is revealed. On Chinese state television, Xi Jinping delivers his New Year address to the nation (pictured). China’s netizens pore over the footage. On no other occasion do they get to see their leader sitting at what purports to be his desk. They swap analysis of Mr Xi’s collection of photographs, displayed on bookshelves behind him. And they parse his ponderously delivered words. “Along the way, we are bound to encounter headwinds,” he said this year. Many will see that as an understatement of <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/25/xi-jinping-steps-up-his-attempt-to-rescue-chinas-economy">China’s woes</a>.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Just over a year ago, Mr Xi abandoned his strict “zero-covid” measures, which had been in force for nearly three years and had led to ever more frequent <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/01/20/china-wants-to-move-on-from-covid-in-shanghai-i-see-the-ghosts-of-lockdown-everywhere">lockdowns</a>. But the country did not experience what Mr Xi described in his speech as a “smooth transition”. China’s under-vaccinated population was ill-prepared: according to some estimates, well over 1m people died of the disease as the country staggered back to normality (officials covered up the actual death toll). The economy failed to gather momentum. Youth unemployment soared, the property market continued to slump and foreign investors grew more nervous. The headwinds were fierce. The coming year looks hardly less troubled.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Xi will try to put on a brave face. He will send an unusually large delegation to schmooze with plutocrats at the World Economic Forum in mid-January, an annual gathering of the rich and powerful in Davos, Switzerland. Reuters, a news agency, says the team will be led by China’s prime minister, Li Qiang—the highest-ranking Chinese official to attend in person since Mr Xi himself showed up in 2017. Mr Li, a protégé of Mr Xi, got the job in March 2023 after serving as Communist Party leader in Shanghai. He impressed foreigners there with his business-friendly ways.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">He will find that much harder in Davos. When Mr Xi went there, it was different. Many officials and firms in the West were shuddering at the prospect of Donald Trump’s presidency (he was about to be sworn in) and the impact that his threatened trade war with China would have on global growth. They were enraptured by Mr Xi’s efforts to portray himself as a champion of free trade. Now many of them see China as a source of risk, whether caused by the country’s faltering economy, strategic rivalry with America or Mr Xi’s own West-loathing politics, with their growing emphasis in all domains on the need to protect national and regime security.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In Western capitals and boardrooms the new year begins with much China-related worry. On January 13th a presidential <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-taiwan-election">election in Taiwan</a> could whip up cross-strait tensions if the front-runner, <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2024/01/04/for-china-taiwans-elections-are-a-looming-crisis">William Lai</a> of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, wins. China sees him as a diehard separatist.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">By the normal political calendar, the party’s Central Committee—a body comprising more than 370 members of the political, military and business elite—should have convened its “third plenum” late in 2023. In the party’s five-yearly cycle of gatherings, third plenums attract much attention because of their usual focus on economic reform. That no such meeting has yet been held in the current cycle has caused much speculation about disharmony among the elite over how to tackle China’s long-term economic difficulties, such as an ageing population, shrinking workforce and high levels of debt. Senior officials did manage to hold an annual conference in December to discuss more immediate economic problems. Nothing that emerged from the gathering suggested any bold new measures to rev up growth.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="665" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_CNC855.png" srcset="../image/20240106_CNC855.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For the economy, 2024 will be no less bumpy than 2023.

The World Bank predicts the economy will grow by 4.5% in 2024 and 4.3% in 2025. There will be “continued fragility” in China’s recovery, it says. Most economists seem to agree (see chart).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Some clues to the government’s economic strategy will be revealed in March at the annual session of China’s rubber-stamp legislature, the National People’s Congress.

At December’s meeting on the economy, officials were told to “strengthen economic propaganda” and “sing the praises of the bright prospects of the Chinese economy”. China’s Ministry of State Security went further. In a commentary on the meeting, posted on social media, it suggested that negativity about the economy was a serious political sin. The aim of people who air disparaging views, it said, was to “attack and deny” Chinese-style socialism in a “futile attempt” to subject the country to “strategic containment and suppression”.</p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="A man browses his smartphone at his store in Xiamen, China" data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20240106_CNP001.jpg" srcset="../image/20240106_CNP001.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Customers wanted</span><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: AP</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">On December 25th , a magazine in Beijing, published a pro-reform editorial, noting that during the Cultural Revolution “the national economy was on the brink of collapse, yet the authorities insisted that the situation was ‘very good’ and ‘getting better and better’.” The article was quickly deleted from ’s website.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In 2024 Mr Xi will be in no mood for dissent. A few days before the zero-covid policy was scrapped, he saw one of the most powerful displays of discontent with the government since the Tiananmen Square unrest of 1989. The protests, though brief and small, broke out in several big cities. Ostensibly they were against covid-related lockdowns, but they also had a political hue. People held up sheets of white paper to symbolise opposition to censorship. As their counterparts did in Tiananmen, they sang the communist anthem, the “Internationale”—loved by protesters in China not for its ideological message, but for its language of revolt. In Shanghai some even shouted “Communist Party step down” and “Xi Jinping step down”. In a country so saturated with surveillance technology, it was an extraordinary moment of bravery. Mr Xi will remain haunted by it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Throughout 2023 police tracked down participants, warning many and detaining some. Fear has taken hold again. A young resident of Beijing describes how the government ordered many of his friends to leave the city because of their roles in the protests. “They’ve had to pay a huge price,” he says. At a meeting on December 23rd to discuss their priorities in 2024, police chiefs around the country were ordered by their bosses in Beijing to “tighten the strings of political security” and step up “proactive” efforts to protect China’s political system and its ideological sanctity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In Hong Kong security will be a prominent theme of the political year, too. The territory is planning to adopt new laws in 2024 relating to crimes such as treason, secession, sedition and subversion. This is required by article 23 of China’s mini-constitution for Hong Kong, the Basic Law, but previous efforts to enact such legislation have been frustrated by strong public opposition. Since an eruption of anti-government unrest in Hong Kong in 2019, China’s sweeping clampdown on dissent in the territory has cleared the way for these laws to be passed. Few observers believe that residents would dare to organise any large protests. In the coming months verdicts will be reached in juryless trials of dozens of Hong Kong’s most prominent pro-democracy activists. The outcomes could cast an even deeper chill over Hong Kong’s shrinking space for free speech.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Turbulence at the top</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Among China’s leaders, the purges that have been an ever-present feature of Mr Xi’s rule will continue apace. The past year saw a dramatic display of these, with the ousting of a foreign minister, Qin Gang, and  a defence minister, General Li Shangfu—both of whom had been in the job for just a few months. No reasons have been given for the dismissals, but it is believed that Mr Qin’s related at least in part to an extramarital affair and General Li’s to corruption. Mr Qin was replaced by his predecessor, Wang Yi. After months without a defence minister, China named a new one on December 29th: Admiral Dong Jun, a former chief of the navy. On the same day, nine military officials were purged from the legislature, without explanation.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It is sometimes difficult to tell what motivates these shake-ups. Mr Xi is waging a relentless war on corruption as well as a campaign to enforce loyalty to his rule; there may be hidden political reasons why certain people are targeted for graft. But in the financial industry, fighting corruption appears to be the main reason for a sweeping clean-up in the past year. State media say that in 2023 more than 100 financial officials, mostly bankers, were rounded up for graft. The campaign is “expected to be ratcheted up” in 2024, says Jiemian, a Shanghai-based business-news portal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">So is Mr Xi’s control of financial affairs generally. In March 2023 he announced the setting up of a new party-led agency, the Central Financial Commission, to take charge of all financial matters. Its duties include oversight of watchdogs such as the People’s Bank of China, the central bank, and the newly established National Administration for Financial Regulation. He also re-established a long-disbanded body—the Central Financial Work Commission—to enforce party discipline. Far from reinvigorating pro-market reforms, the third plenum, whenever it is held, will probably stress the party’s—and Mr Xi’s—leadership of everything. The glumness that has settled over China’s private sector is unlikely to be dispelled in 2024.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Xi may hope that China’s troubles will be offset by malaise in the West, such as divisions over support for Ukraine and Israel’s war in Gaza, and political strife in America as a presidential election looms. But the West’s anxieties about China will not abate—whoever wins America’s election, China will remain a bugbear in Washington. America will keep trying to handicap the development of cutting-edge technology in China with restrictions on investment and trade. Economic friction between China and the West will grow, not least as governments in Europe struggle to protect their car industries from a deluge of cheap electric vehicles (<small>EV</small>s) made in China. The European Commission is investigating whether Chinese <small>EV</small>s receive subsidies that violate trade rules. Punitive tariffs could ensue.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Xi will exploit such moves to portray his country as a victim, hoping to nurture nationalist sentiment. Celebrations in October of China’s 75th anniversary as a communist state will be milked for the same purpose. (A new law on patriotic education, which took effect on January 1st, will hammer home the point that sharing this sentiment is not optional.) But nationalism is not entirely effective as a bulwark against the party’s critics: the protests in 2022 showed that. Murmurings about Mr Xi’s rule, fanned by the country’s troubles since then, will probably remain mostly private. But they are unlikely to subside in the upcoming year of the dragon. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/china/"><span>China</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Chaguan</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">For China, Taiwan’s elections are a looming crisis</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Xi Jinping wants Joe Biden to constrain Taiwan’s democracy for him</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_CND000.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">X</span><small>I JINPING HAS</small> a lot riding on upcoming elections in Taiwan.

Logically, the party chief would rather fulfil that promise without betting his regime on an all-out invasion of Taiwan, which would risk war with America. A safer option involves some mix of blandishments and strangulation, both economic and military, leading to capitulation by Taiwan’s political and business elites. Peace has long rested on America deterring Chinese aggression, and on China deterring Taiwan from declaring independence. It also rests on party bosses being able to plausibly maintain that such a negotiated settlement is possible, not least to China’s people, schooled to believe that most in Taiwan long to return to the motherland.</p><aside class="css-d2tu32 e1x5fpv0" data-component="infobox"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It is nearly 75 years since China’s civil war ended with Communist Party control of the mainland, and with exile on Taiwan for the Nationalist, or Kuomintang (<small>KMT</small>), regime. Today the island is a raucous democracy, marked by divisions about ties to China. If on <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/01/04/america-braces-for-taiwans-election-and-vice-versa">January 13th</a> Taiwanese voters hand the presidency to William Lai Ching-te, the candidate of Taiwan’s pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (<small>DPP</small>), they will cast fresh doubt on the prospects for a peaceful, negotiated unification.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Victory for Mr Lai would mark the <small>DPP</small>’s third presidential win in a row. Chinese officials and scholars have issued warnings—notably to counterparts in America, Taiwan’s superpower protector—that they have no trust in Mr Lai, whom they call a dangerous, lifelong campaigner for Taiwanese independence. According to Chinese warnings, there would be “no wait and see” period after a Lai victory. To deter a President-elect Lai from radical moves, the People’s Liberation Army can be expected to stage exercises that threaten Taiwan in new ways, it is said. These would aim to show resolve to the Chinese public and to teach the island’s voters that they have rejected the path of peace. New provocations could include unmanned Chinese aircraft flying over Taiwan, or China’s navy or coastguard finding a pretext to search island-bound ships. China recently reimposed tariffs on some Taiwanese goods, arguing that the current <small>DPP</small>-led government had trampled commitments needed to preserve a cross-strait trade deal, the Economic Co-operation Framework Agreement (<small>ECFA</small>). Victory for Mr Lai could see the <small>ECFA </small>suspended in its entirety.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Worryingly, the Chinese side has (or pretends to have) unrealistic expectations that President Joe Biden and his administration would help to constrain a Lai presidency. In part, that nods to China’s scornful insistence that the <small>DPP</small>—and indeed Taiwan’s voters—are America’s hapless pawns in a superpower game to hold China down. In part, it reflects a Chinese hunch that America does not trust Mr Lai, either. When the <small>DPP</small> candidate visited America last August in his capacity as Taiwanese vice-president, his meetings were strictly controlled by his American hosts, and Chinese diplomats briefed in advance on his itinerary. China should be realistic, though. True, over the past 20 years American officials have offered bruising, public rebukes to <small>DPP</small> leaders, urging them not to provoke China. But Washington politics have changed. If China bullies Mr Lai, America will have to back him up.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">China sees Taiwan’s election as a test of American sincerity. Mr Biden insists that he does not support Taiwanese independence, but muddles that message with unconditional pledges to defend the island in a crisis, says Xiang Lanxin of the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. For China, Taiwan’s election is “an opportunity for America to clarify what its position really is”, he suggests. Against that, several Chinese scholars suggest that their country has few incentives to stoke a big crisis over Taiwan before America’s presidential contest in November. Mr Xi needs to know whether he will face Mr Biden again or the transactional Donald Trump, who talks tough on China but has no great love for Taiwan.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Lai’s victory is not assured, with the presidential vote split three ways. In reality, a win for the second-ranked candidate, Hou Yu-ih of the <small>KMT</small>, might also offer its own painful clarity about the prospects for peaceful unification. Mr Hou, a mayor and former police chief, urges dialogue with the mainland. But Taiwan has changed. Today’s <small>KMT</small> cannot offer Mr Xi the same concessions that the party did just a decade ago. For China, a Hou presidency could be as frustrating as another <small>DPP </small>term, just in a different way.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">A peace offer backed with threats</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Along with Taiwan’s presidential race, China’s leaders will be watching parliamentary elections held on the same day. Quite possibly the <small>KMT</small> and a newer, centrist outfit, the Taiwan People’s Party, may do well and secure a majority in the Legislative Yuan and significant control over the agenda of the next president, even if that is Mr Lai of the <small>DPP</small>. In that case, Taiwan’s rambunctious democracy would be keeping alive Communist Party hopes of imposing its rule without a war, for now at least.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">If both presidential and legislative elections are a rout of the <small>KMT</small>, that will trigger heated debate on the mainland about whether that party has a future, scholars predict. Over the past century China’s Communist Party and the <small>KMT</small> have been variously comrades in arms, enemies in a civil war and now uneasy partners in cross-strait dialogue, bound by a shared hostility to Taiwanese independence. Familiarity has not bred respect. When <small>KMT</small> leaders visit the mainland and complain that aggressive Chinese policies make it hard to woo Taiwanese voters, Communist Party bosses hear the <small>KMT</small> whining about its own political incompetence. China is learning that elections have consequences. For Mr Xi’s party, that is always someone else’s fault. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Read more from Chaguan, our columnist on China:<br/></b></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/china/"><span>China</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->China is going downhill</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Millions of Chinese have embraced skiing</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">The country has seen a post-pandemic boom in winter sports</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_CNP002.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">E</span><small>YES WIDE</small> and arms flailing, a skier slowly makes her way down the slope at Mission Hills.

New resorts were built. According to the government, some 300m Chinese (out of a population of 1.4bn) have taken part in a winter sport since 2015. Those figures may be an overestimate, but this mass campaign appears more appealing to middle-class Chinese than others of a more ideological nature.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">“If sports are strong, a nation is strong,” Mr Xi has said. China won just one gold medal at the Winter Olympics in 2018, but nine in 2022. To achieve that success it naturalised some foreign athletes, notably <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/02/03/cold-warrior-why-eileen-gu-ditched-team-usa-to-ski-for-china">Eileen Gu</a>. The freestyle skier was born in America, but decided to compete for China, becoming the face of the Beijing games. She won two golds at the Olympics and claimed victory again in December at the Freestyle Skiing World Cup, which was also held in China.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But the government’s promotion of winter sports is about more than just medals. China’s most recent five-year plan included targets for participation in sports and exercise. The primary goal is increased fitness. Around half of China’s population is overweight, reported the National Health Commission in 2020. The state would also like Chinese holidaymakers to spend their money on activities at home—such as skiing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Most skiers in China are beginners, so few complain that the country’s destinations tend to have tiny slopes with gentle inclines. The largest Chinese resorts are the size of small European ones. Mission Hills devotes more space to photo opportunities and shoot-em-up games than skiing. But those who master its simple, single run have something to look forward to: in 2025 the world’s largest indoor ski centre will open in Shenzhen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For now, Chinese seeking steeper slopes might consider the north-western region of Xinjiang, with its high mountains and long winters. Xinjiang has 64 ski resorts, nearly 10% of China’s total. Xinhua, the state news agency, says visitors to the prefecture of Altay, a wonderland for skiers, increased six-fold over the five years to 2022. While boosting the local economy, skiing also distracts from the human-rights abuses that the government has inflicted upon Xinjiang over the past decade.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The Communist Party even claims that Xinjiang is the birthplace of skiing. The evidence? Rock paintings in Altay—which date back 12,000 years, according to state media—apparently depict hunters on skis.

Many of them had gathered to mourn the commander of the Quds Force, the foreign-operations wing of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (<small>IRGC</small>), who was assassinated in an American strike four years ago. Iran first blamed “terrorists” and then America and Israel for the latest blasts.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The risks of war on the Lebanese border first shot up in the hours and days immediately after the Hamas attack on Israel, which had feared that a similar strike was about to be carried out by Hamas’s ally, Hizbullah. Many of the hundreds of thousands of reservists called up that day were sent north.

Urgings of restraint from America’s president, Joe Biden, who deployed an aircraft-carrier strike group off the coast of Lebanon, also played a part in convincing the Israelis to wait. In a visit to Israel on October 18th Mr Biden issued a warning. “To any state or any other hostile actor thinking about attacking Israel,” he said. “Don’t. Don’t.

For the most part, both sides have hit targets close to the border, in accordance with tacit rules of engagement established over the years. In Israel and Lebanon, tens of thousands of civilians have fled the fighting, with cities like Israel’s Shlomi and Kiryat Shmona rendered ghost-towns. Over three months Hizbullah has lost more than 146 of its fighters, while 15 Israelis have been killed by the missiles.

Lebanon suffered most, with over a thousand civilians killed and massive damage done to infrastructure.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Hizbullah insists on defining itself as a “resistance” movement and has built up a formidable arsenal of around 150,000 missiles. A few hundred of these have the range and accuracy to hit anywhere in Israel.

Israeli soldiers, currently occupied with locating and destroying Hizbullah missile teams from afar, are prepared to go on the offensive.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Western officials say the <small>IDF</small> has the military capacity to open a second front, even while the war in Gaza is going on, and to quickly envelop Hizbullah positions near the border within hours. Though a wider conflagration has at times appeared inevitable, efforts to defuse the situation persist. Hizbullah has withdrawn fighters from positions right on the fence to ones some 2-3km away from the border. This may be just a tactical retreat, but it is also a signal to the Israelis and the Americans that it wants to avoid a fight. Meanwhile, the <small>IDF</small> has slightly reduced its force-levels, though they are still much higher than before October 7th. The Israelis are ready to go on the offensive at any moment.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Both sides have compelling reasons to avoid an escalation. Israel is embroiled in a bloody campaign on the ground in Gaza and has lost some 1,400 citizens and soldiers since October 7th. Hizbullah, for its part, knows it will not make itself popular by inviting Israeli retribution, particularly since many Lebanese remember the destruction of the war in 2006 and are watching the devastation of Gaza—where more than 22,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed. Iran, which has seen Israel destroy a large part of Hamas’s military capabilities, is loth to squander its investment in Hizbullah, which provides a deterrent to an Israeli strike on Iran’s own nuclear facilities.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Even so, Iran has been freely using its proxies elsewhere in the region to keep Israel on edge. Militias it backs have launched rockets against Israel from Syria and Yemen, while in Iraq they are attacking American forces. The Houthis, who control large parts of Yemen, have also been disrupting global trade with attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea. An international naval task-force led by America has been trying to guard shipping sailing through the Bab el-Mandeb strait, a key route that goes past Yemen and leads to the Suez canal. But major shipping lines are rerouting around South Africa, leading to longer and costlier voyages. Western ships have shot down a number of Houthi missiles and sunk several small Houthi boats.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Yet America is finding it hard to maintain its massive deployment in the region, which has helped to tamp down hostilities. On January 1st it said a carrier group would return to base, though a second one is still in the vicinity, as is a Marine force of about 2,000 troops. Even so, Israel worries that as America draws down its forces, its ability to deter Iran or Hizbullah from attacking Israel will diminish.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Israel’s response has been to try picking apart Iran’s proxies without provoking a wider backlash. On December 25th an air strike it almost certainly carried out near Damascus killed Razi Mousavi, a brigadier-general in Iran’s Quds Force. Mr Mousavi served for many years as a liaison between the <small>IRGC</small> and Hizbullah and other Iranian-armed militant groups in the region.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Outsiders are trying to cool the situation on the Lebanese border. A close adviser to President Biden has been frequently visiting Israel and Lebanon in an attempt to broker an agreement that would defuse the situation. The basis for this could be <small>UN</small> Resolution 1701, passed at the end of the war in 2006. It is supposed to keep Hizbullah’s forces north of the Litani river, which runs roughly parallel to the border, about 29km to the north. But the Lebanese army and the <small>UN</small>’s peacekeeping force in Lebanon, <small>UNIFIL</small>, which are tasked with enforcing the resolution, have failed to do so.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">But stop digging tunnels</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Israel claims that since 2006 Hizbullah has placed hundreds of rocket-launchers in civilian buildings across southern Lebanon in defiance of the <small>UN</small> resolution. In December 2018 the <small>IDF</small> revealed six cross-border tunnels excavated by Hizbullah in preparation for future attacks. Hizbullah has also set up observation posts along the border under the guise of an ecological front group named Green Without Borders. Many of these have been hit by Israel since October 7th.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Talks are not helped by Lebanon’s dysfunctional politics. The country has not had a president since October 2022 and has been run since then by a caretaker government. Yet some kind of agreement is not impossible. In October 2022 Israel and Lebanon agreed to demarcate their maritime border to allow for the exploration and exploitation of offshore gasfields in an area that each claimed belonged to its exclusive economic zone.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">And although the leaders on each side are given to bombastic statements, in practice they have proved to be cautious. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, has long exercised restraint in response to attacks across the border. And Hassan Nasrallah, Hizbullah’s leader for over three decades and Iran’s most powerful ally in the region, has seemed reluctant to provoke another war after badly miscalculating that Israel would not respond forcefully to Hizbullah’s raid in 2006.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Israel’s gamble is that he will remain cautious, even as it attacks Hamas’s leaders in Lebanon, and that he would rather pull his troops back across the Litani than risk losing them to an Israeli attack. “Nasrallah can contain this,” says one Israeli military official. “It’s still his choice.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/middle-east-and-africa/"><span>Middle East and Africa</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->No relief</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">War, hunger and disease stalk Gaza’s 2.2m people </h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">The territory is on the verge of famine after three months of war</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_MAP002.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">A</span><small>SK</small> <small>anyone</small> in Gaza what he or she ate yesterday, and the answer will be brief.

Much of it is in ruins. Yoav Gallant, the defence minister, says the army has destroyed the 12 Hamas battalions that were there. Sending reservists home could give some respite to Israel’s economy, which is short of workers due to the mass mobilisation. It could also appease America, which has pushed Israel to shift to a lower-intensity campaign of targeted raids.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But it will bring scant relief to Gazans, who have endured three months of war. The <small>UN</small> estimates that 85% of the territory’s 2.2m people have been displaced. Hundreds of thousands have ended up in Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza, which is now more densely populated than New York City. Luckier ones found shelter with family or friends.

After a stay in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, he moved to Rafah in early December. He sent a photo of how his family of six has lived for the past month: under a tarpaulin held up by plywood scavenged from a construction site. “We were lucky,” he says. “The people arriving now, they can’t find wood.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Cramped, filthy conditions are spreading disease. The World Health Organisation says that 180,000 people are suffering from respiratory infections. It has recorded 136,400 cases of diarrhoea and 55,400 cases of lice and scabies, among other ailments. Only about one-third of Gaza’s hospitals are even partly functional, and they are short of basic supplies; those in the south are operating at three times their intended capacity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For most families, though, the most pressing concern is food. The <small>WFP</small> says that “virtually all households” in Gaza are skipping meals and that 26% of the territory’s population suffers from an “extreme lack of food”. The <small>WFP</small> has three criteria for declaring a famine. Gaza already meets at least one of them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Israel says it is not obstructing aid deliveries to Gaza. It blames Hamas for stealing supplies, and the <small>UN</small> and charities for not sending more. There is evidence that the former claim is true, but even if it were not, the aid entering Gaza would be insufficient to feed the population. On some days fewer than 100 lorries enter the enclave, compared with 500 before the war, when Gaza also had its own farms to provide food. The few products in local markets have soared in price: a sack of flour now costs around 500 shekels ($137), ten times its pre-war cost.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">As for not sending enough supplies, aid workers would like to bring more into Gaza, but the logistics are a nightmare. Lorries must be inspected at an Israeli-controlled checkpoint, where an ever growing list of prohibited goods (including things like water filters) are removed. The Rafah border crossing with Egypt is not designed for large volumes of goods. Once inside Gaza, lorries must navigate damaged roads and daily bombing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Though it sent some reservists home, Israel insists there are long months of fighting ahead.

For much of 2023 Israelis had taken to the streets to protest against the government’s efforts to <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/24/a-blow-against-israels-supreme-court-plunges-the-country-into-crisis">weaken the power of judges</a> to overrule the government, a step many saw as an attack on Israel’s democracy. Yet when on January 1st Israel’s highest court struck down the judicial-reform law passed just six months earlier, most Israelis shrugged. Since Hamas attacked in October, killing or kidnapping some 1,400 people and <a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">sparking a war in Gaza</a>, Israelis have had bigger issues to worry about. Even so, the ruling is a notable blow to the right-wing government led by <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/27/binyamin-netanyahu-has-lost-his-aura-of-invincibility">Binyamin Netanyahu</a>, and its ramifications will be felt long after the fighting in Gaza has ended.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The court’s former president, Esther Hayut, in one of the last rulings of her tenure which ended in October, said that this was one of the “rare cases where the beating heart of a constitution…is harmed”. She was referring to an amendment passed last July in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, which all but eliminated the court’s ability to overturn government decisions that it deemed “unreasonable”.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Only a bare majority, eight of the court’s 15 judges, ruled to nullify the legislation itself, but there was an additional ruling of even greater significance. Twelve of the judges agreed that, in principle, the Supreme Court has the power to strike down changes to Israel’s quasi-constitutional Basic Laws, in “rare and extreme cases [where] the Knesset has overstepped its constitutional powers”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It was a stern rebuke to Mr Netanyahu’s coalition, which took power at the end of 2022 promising to weaken the independence of the Supreme Court. The legal reforms proposed by Yariv Levin, the hardline minister of justice, went beyond giving the government and parliament immunity from the court’s “reasonableness standard”. They included giving the governing coalition control over the appointments of judges and ending the professional independence of the government’s legal counsels. Yet amid widespread protests and civil unrest, the coalition government had succeeded in forcing through only its abolition of the reasonableness standard. Now the court has put an end to that initiative, too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Levin responded to the ruling by saying that the judges had “taken into their hands all the authorities that are supposed to be divided between the three branches of government in a democracy”. However, in a nod to the war, he added that the coalition would “act with restraint and responsibility”. Senior members of the ruling Likud party acknowledged in private that this was “the end of the legal reform”. Mr Netanyahu’s government has plummeted in the polls since the war began and it is unlikely to relaunch such a controversial policy once the war ends, when many expect the country to hold early elections.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The court’s ruling in defence of its own powers to overturn the government is a bold one, given that Israel does not have a formal written constitution defining the separation of powers between the judiciary, legislature and executive. Yet the ruling will not put an end to the battle over the character of Israel’s democracy—between right-wing and religious sections of Israeli society on the one hand and liberal, secular ones on the other—that led to the government’s efforts to hobble the judges in the first place. When Israel declared its independence in 1948, it postponed passing a constitution because those disagreements seemed too difficult to resolve and, in any case, it had a war to fight. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/middle-east-and-africa/"><span>Middle East and Africa</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->A storm over a port </span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Ethiopia’s gambit for a port is unsettling a volatile region</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Abiy Ahmed is doing a deal for a stretch of Somaliland’s coast</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_MAP501.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">G</span><small>EOPOLITICS IN THE</small> Horn of Africa is already off to a combustible start in the new year. On January 1st Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, and Muse Bihi Abdi, his counterpart in the would-be state of Somaliland next door, delivered a surprise announcement. At a press conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital, they revealed that landlocked Ethiopia is to lease a naval port and a 20km stretch of Red Sea coastline in the breakaway Somali state. In exchange, Somaliland is to receive shares in Ethiopian Airlines and—much more significantly—possibly official diplomatic recognition by the Ethiopian government. This would make Ethiopia the first country to formally recognise the former British colony, which <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/05/06/somaliland-an-unrecognised-state-is-winning-friends-abroad">declared independence</a> from the rest of Somalia more than three decades ago.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="626" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_MAM964.png" srcset="../image/20240106_MAM964.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The deal has thrown an already volatile part of the world into even greater uncertainty. Authorities in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, have reacted furiously to the news that Ethiopia is willing to break with the African Union’s long-standing policy against redrawing the continental map. “Abiy is messing things up in Somalia,” complains an adviser to Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, Somalia’s president. Just three days earlier Mr Mohamud and Mr Abdi had signed an agreement to resume talks over Somaliland’s disputed constitutional status. That deal is now in tatters.  Somalia declared the new agreement “null and void” and recalled its ambassador from Addis Ababa. Mr Mohamud said the deal would serve only to fuel support for al-Shabab, the al-Qaeda-linked jihadist group that controls much of the countryside of Somalia and first emerged partly in response to Ethiopia’s invasion of it in 2006.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Abiy, by contrast, portrayed the deal as a diplomatic triumph that fulfils Ethiopia’s decades-long <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/02/ethiopias-prime-minister-wants-a-red-sea-harbour">quest</a> for direct access to the sea. In recent months the prime minister had alarmed observers with bellicose calls for Ethiopia’s roughly 120m people to break out of what he has termed a “geographical prison”.  Though Ethiopia once had two ports as well as a navy, it lost these when Eritrea, a region to the north, seceded to form its own country in 1993. Since a bloody border war between 1998 and 2000, which deprived it of access to Eritrea’s coastline, Ethiopia has relied on the port of Djibouti for almost all its external trade. In 2018 it struck a deal with Somaliland in which it was to acquire a 19% stake in the recently expanded port of Berbera, some 160km from Somaliland’s capital, Hargeisa. Leaders in Mogadishu were furious; four years later the deal fell through.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Abiy has long made plain his ambition to make Ethiopia a power on the Red Sea and in the Bab el-Mandeb strait, one of the world’s busiest and most <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/03/26/why-the-suez-canal-and-other-choke-points-face-growing-pressure">geopolitically contested</a> shipping lanes. A peace agreement with Eritrea was hailed at the time as an opportunity for Ethiopia to regain tax-free access to its neighbour’s ports. The prime minister also mentioned an opaque deal with Somalia’s former president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, for Ethiopia to use four unnamed ports along the coastline of Somalia, including Somaliland’s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Neither materialised. More recently foreign diplomats and analysts have fretted that Ethiopia’s prime minister, who is by turns messianic and unpredictable, plans to go to war with Eritrea in order to grab a slice of its coast. Now, though, Abiy can claim to have achieved his goals through diplomacy. “In accordance with the promise we repeatedly made to our people, [we have realised] the desire to access the Red Sea,” he declared. “We don’t have a desire to forcefully coerce anyone.”</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For Somaliland’s leaders the deal marks a breakthrough in its three-decade-long quest for international recognition. “Somalia has been using delaying tactics ever since talks began in 2012,” says Mohamed Farah of the Academy for Peace and Development, a think-tank in Hargeisa. “We can’t wait for ever.” Their hope is that where Ethiopia goes, the rest of Africa will follow: the African Union is based in Addis Ababa. Abiy also enjoys strong relations with the United Arab Emirates (<small>UAE</small>). Some foreign diplomats suspect the <small>UAE</small>, which is also close to Somalia’s government, may have played a part in brokering the deal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Its announcement came just as Abiy also played host to Sudan’s most notorious warlord, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (better known as Hemedti), whose paramilitary force, flush with Emirati cash and arms, is <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/16/a-genocidal-militia-is-winning-the-war-in-sudan">closing in on victory</a> over the Sudanese army. In this view an Ethiopian military base in Somaliland is the latest step in an Emirati plan to secure a sphere of influence throughout the broader Gulf region and Horn of Africa.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Further turmoil is likely. Though Eritrea’s rulers may breathe more easily now that Abiy appears to have achieved his goals without resorting to arms, the prospect, however distant, of an Ethiopian navy on their doorstep will hardly be welcome. Djibouti, which stands to lose out from competition for Ethiopia’s trade flows, is also unhappy. The deal will probably also displease Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which are at odds with the <small>UAE</small> in its bid for regional dominance. To calm nerves, Somalia is appealing to the African Union and the <small>UN</small> Security Council to intervene. But as one Western diplomat notes, “This is an age where, if you’re ruthless and reckless, nobody gets in your way.” It is a lesson that Abiy has long taken to heart. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/middle-east-and-africa/"><span>Middle East and Africa</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->They voted, sort of</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">A thumping win for Tshisekedi in Congo’s election raises eyebrows</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0"> The opposition has few good options</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_MAP003.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>he slick</small> ceremony to hail the results of Congo’s presidential election in a hall of bigwigs in fancy suits gave off an air of official competence.

(After the last election, in 2018, Mr Tshisekedi was declared the victor despite the Catholic Church’s parallel count and leaked official data showing that another candidate, Martin Fayulu, had easily won.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The opposition says that widespread cheating included ballot-stuffing. Much of this would not be revealed by the parallel count, says Bienvenu Matumo, an activist with <small>LUCHA</small>, a rights group. For example, an unverified video shows someone in a private apartment with a voting machine casting vote after vote for Mr Tshisekedi. Still, the opposition has yet to provide detailed evidence to back its claims.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It is clear, in any event, that the election was utterly chaotic. Millions waited for hours to vote. Many gave up or never found their name on the voting lists. The electoral process was a “huge failure” that left many disenfranchised and angry, says Richard Moncrieff of Crisis Group, a think-tank based in Brussels. Almost 60% of polling stations opened late, often because the voting papers had not arrived or because voting machines malfunctioned, according to <small>SYMOCEL</small>, a local observer group. Voting also stopped for 30 minutes or more in about a third of polling stations. And the electoral commission announced without a legal basis that the polling would continue for another day in some areas. In fact it was still going on, in some parts of the country, for six more days.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Official turnout was 43%, the lowest since multi-party elections resumed in 2006. Alarmingly, at least 11,000 of 75,000 polling stations did not open at all. The commission failed to clarify why or where those were. That one in six polling stations were summarily cast aside also bodes ill for the simultaneous elections to the national assembly, whose results have been delayed amid investigations into fraud. Earlier this year, another 1.7m Congolese in the east had not even registered to vote, because of the war. How many missing voters, it may be asked, does it take to invalidate the results of an election?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Tshisekedi’s supporters argue that their man was plainly the most popular because the economy has grown steadily and the president has declared, among other things, free primary education for all. He was helped by a divided opposition and heavy and favourable coverage by the state broadcaster. The country seemed to be smothered in his posters.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">He also boasted alliances with regional bigwigs such as Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former warlord in the north whom the International Criminal Court in The Hague had convicted of crimes against humanity (a verdict later overturned), and Vital Kamerhe, convicted in 2020 of embezzling $48m (a verdict also overturned).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Perhaps the key to Mr Tshisekedi’s apparent success was his repeated claim, without evidence, that Mr Katumbi was a foreigner and in bed with Rwanda, which backs rebels in eastern Congo. This helped Mr Tshisekedi cast himself as a defender of Congo’s sovereignty. He even promised to declare war on Rwanda if re-elected.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Both Mr Katumbi and Mr Fayulu, who calls the results a “new coup d’état”, say they will not appeal to the constitutional court because they claim it is not independent. Instead they will try to rally people in the streets. That will be difficult A small protest in Kinshasa, the capital, was clobbered by the police. The army was sent in there the day the results were declared.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">“The time for action has arrived,” said Mr Katumbi on January 3rd, calling for peaceful protests while castigating some of Congo’s allies. “Tell me, in which country in the world can you find voting machines in the hands of the ruling party’s candidates and one still rushes to congratulate the winner?” Western governments that put access to Congolese minerals above democracy are loth to be swayed. Congo had an opportunity to do things differently and have an election that did not end in a crisis of legitimacy, says Mr Kibangula, the dismayed think-tanker. “We did not take the opportunity.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/europe/"><span>Europe</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Battle of wills</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">A New Year’s interview with Volodymyr Zelensky</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">The Ukrainian president remains defiant, despite the prospect of a bleak year ahead</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_EUP001.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>he president</small> of Ukraine is angry; not about the <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/30/putin-seems-to-be-winning-the-war-in-ukraine-for-now">successes of his enemies</a> (he sees none) nor even about his own army’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/the-war-in-ukraine-may-be-heading-for-stalemate">lack of progress</a> on the battlefield.

Russia is <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/29/russia-tries-to-overwhelm-ukraine-with-missiles">still striking</a> at Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Odessa and elsewhere, but the world is no longer listening as intently and the master-communicator no longer controls the narrative as he did two years ago. In Ukraine, weariness is setting in. In the West headlines ask whether Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has started to win. Aid to Ukrainians has become a subject for <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/12/20/a-majority-of-congressmen-want-more-military-aid-for-ukraine">political horse-trading in America</a> and Europe.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The West has lost a sense of urgency and many Ukrainians have lost a sense of existential threat, Mr Zelensky says. He is now trying to rekindle both. “Maybe we did not succeed [in 2023] as the world wanted. Maybe not everything is as fast as someone imagined,” he says, but the idea that Mr Putin is winning is no more than a “feeling”. The reality, he says, is that Russian forces are still being slaughtered in places like Avdiivka, from where he has just returned. British defence intelligence sources estimate that, on current trends, Russia will have suffered more than 500,000 casualties, killed and wounded, by 2025.</p><aside class="css-d2tu32 e1x5fpv0" data-component="infobox"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">“Thousands, thousands of killed Russian soldiers, nobody even took them away.” He emphasises that Mr Putin’s army failed to take a single large city in 2023, whereas Ukraine was able to break through Russia’s blockade of <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/05/the-war-in-ukraine-is-threatening-to-wash-across-the-black-sea">the Black Sea</a> and is now shipping millions of tonnes of grain abroad using a new route that hugs Ukraine’s southern coast. “Huge result!” the president declares.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Yet, as a former actor who managed to change how the world sees Ukraine, Mr Zelensky knows that perceptions can become reality in less helpful ways, too. In a war that has become about mobilising resources, the belief among Ukraine’s backers that victory has become impossible risks starving Ukraine of the money and arms that it needs to win. Fatalism can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">That is what makes the coming year so vital. As Russia’s war effort cranks up a gear and Ukraine’s resources are depleted, the attention of America and many European countries is shifting to domestic politics in a<a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/2024-is-the-biggest-election-year-in-history"> year of elections</a>. Mr Zelensky’s task is harder than ever. The stakes have not been higher since those first days of fighting.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Central to his argument is that by supporting Ukraine, Europe is protecting itself from Russian aggression. “Giving us money or giving us weapons, you support yourself. You save your children, not ours,” he warns bleakly. If Russia is allowed to take <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/04/grief-camps-help-ukrainian-children-face-the-loss-of-parents">Ukrainian children</a>, “they will take other children”. If Russia violates the rights of Ukrainians, “it will violate the rights in the world”. If Ukraine loses, warns Mr Zelensky, Mr Putin will bring his wars closer to the West. “Putin feels weakness like an animal, because he is an animal. He senses blood, he senses his strength. And he will eat you for dinner with all your <small>EU</small>, <small>NATO</small>, freedom, and democracy.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">With hunched shoulders, Mr Zelensky rams home his points by banging his fingers on the white formica desk of the situation room: “Maybe something is missing. Or maybe someone is missing. Someone who can talk about Ukraine as a defence of all of us.” European countries should be lobbying America to support Ukraine for their own sake. “Intelligence services of several European countries have started to [examine] a possibility of attack on their territory from Russia...even those countries that were not in the <small>USSR</small>.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">As for talk of negotiations, Mr Zelensky does not detect “any fundamental steps forward to the peace from Russia”. What he and Ukrainians experience instead is a barrage of aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities in the east, south, north and west. “I see only the steps of a terrorist country.” And if Russia sends signals about wanting to freeze the conflict, as some media have reported, “it is not because they are righteous men, but because they don’t have enough missiles, ammunition or prepared troops. They need this pause. Restore all their strength. And then with all their strength, turn the page of this war.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Zelensky gives little away about what Ukraine can achieve in 2024, saying that leaks before last summer’s counter-offensive helped Russia prepare its defences. But if he has a message, it is that <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/25/war-has-arrived-in-crimea">Crimea</a> and the connected battle in the Black Sea will become the war’s centre of gravity. Isolating Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, and degrading Russia’s military capability there, “is extremely important for us, because it’s the way for us to reduce the number of attacks from that region,” he says.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="891" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_EUM908.png" srcset="../image/20240106_EUM908.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A successful operation would be an “example to the world”, he continues. It would also have a big effect inside Russia. Losing a centrepiece of the Kremlin’s propaganda would show that “thousands of Russian officers died just because of Putin’s ambition.” Ukraine is already scoring improbable victories on the strategically important peninsula, destroying a “good number” of ships in the Black Sea fleet—British officials say that a fifth of that fleet has been destroyed in the past four months alone. Losing naval bases that Russia has held for the past 240 years would be a huge embarrassment for Mr Putin.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But Mr Zelensky says that the speed of any success will depend on the military assistance he gets from Western partners. He has asked for the Taurus, a German-made, long-range stealth cruise missile with the ability to explode deep inside a target. This could enable Ukraine to destroy the $4bn Kerch bridge, in effect isolating the Crimean peninsula from Russia. “Russia has to know that for us this is a military object.” He suggests the Germans are not the only Western power standing in his way.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Zelensky is still less open about his goals in the east and <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/29/trenches-and-tech-on-ukraines-southern-front">the south</a>. Ukraine’s stated strategic ambition to restore Ukraine to its original borders has not changed, and will not, but he is no longer setting timelines and makes no promises about how much territory Ukraine can “de-occupy” next year. Its immediate task in the land war will be “to defend the east, to save these very important cities of Ukraine, east and south, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhia, Kherson, Mykolaiv”, and to protect his country’s critical infrastructure.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">The long grind ahead</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The inflated expectations Mr Zelensky created ahead of the counter-offensive of 2023 were partly what led to a sense of disappointment. An <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/01/ukraines-commander-in-chief-on-the-breakthrough-he-needs-to-beat-russia">interview by Valery Zaluzhny</a>, the commander of Ukrainian forces, with  in November 2023 acknowledged the stalemate on the battlefield. Although it initially sparked an angry reaction from Mr Zelensky, it has also given him an opportunity to shift his message. To sustain this grinding war it is not just the West that needs to mobilise, but first and foremost Ukraine itself.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">“We must consider our own strength,” says Mr Zelensky. While he reckons America will in the end provide military aid, Ukraine, he says, is also building up its own production. It was a message he echoed in a defiant and sober New Year address that was markedly less upbeat than his words a year ago. As part of this Plan B, he is asking America to provide licences to Ukraine to produce weapons ranging from artillery systems and missiles to air defence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The “mobilisation of Ukrainian society and of the world” at the start of the war is not present today, Mr Zelensky says. “That needs to change.” Polls suggest that reducing the minimum age for mobilisation from its current 27 years and reducing the grounds for exemption are not popular. But Ukraine’s leader insists there is <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/17/ukraines-army-is-struggling-to-find-good-recruits">no alternative</a>. “Mobilisation is not just a matter of soldiers going to the front. It is about all of us. It is the mobilisation of all efforts. This is the only way to protect our state and de-occupy our land. Let’s be honest, we have switched to domestic politics,” Mr Zelensky says. This is a choice Ukrainians will have to make. “If we continue to focus on domestic politics, we need to call elections. Change the law, the constitution. But forget about counter-offensive actions and de-occupation.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Nearly two years into a full-scale war, Mr Zelenksy has lost his youthful vibrancy. But he insists Ukraine cannot abandon its plan to defeat Russia. “The most important profession a Ukrainian can do at the moment is to be in Ukraine…and for our Western partners, it is to be with Ukraine…If you don’t have the strength, then either get out or step aside. We will not retreat.” The question is whether the master-communicator of 2022 can persuade the rest of the world to share that conviction. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Correction (January 2nd 2024): </b></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/europe/"><span>Europe</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Cancelkulturkampf</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Some German Jews say their country goes too far defending Israel</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">And they find themselves attacked for antisemitism</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_EUP501.jpg" width="auto"/><div class="css-1y6lujj ee5d8yd0"><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">W</span><small>hat do an</small> Indian poet, an Australian political scientist, an Irish folk troupe, a British architect, a Bangladeshi photographer, an American historian of the Holocaust, a Chilean composer, an Israeli-Austrian playwright, a Dutch footballer, a German-Nigerian journalist, a Palestinian novelist, a South African artist and Bernie Sanders, the American senator, have in common? All of them—and many others, too—have in the past three months found themselves abruptly cancelled in Germany. The reasons cited for pulling the plug on their shows, grants, contracts, awards or meetings with public officials have varied slightly. Yet all hang on a single fear: that these disinvited people, quite a few of whom happen to be Jewish, might have said something that someone might see as antisemitic. </p><p class="article__body-text">German ultra-squeamishness about antisemitism did not begin on October 7th, the day Hamas gunmen from Gaza launched a murderous rampage that left 1,200 Israelis dead. There is a context, beginning obviously with the Nazi regime’s murder of 6m European Jews. One answer to that horror by subsequent generations of Germans has been to embrace the creation of Israel as a “happy ending” to their own national nightmare. Over time, says Eyal Weizmann, the British-Israeli leader of Forensic Architecture, a research group that has probed antisemitic attacks in Germany as well as Israeli human-rights violations, Germans have come to see any challenge to this redemption myth as something akin to committing a sin.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">This evolution started decades ago, with Germany’s decision to offer war reparations not just to Holocaust survivors but also to the new Jewish state. In the late 1960s the darker chapters in German history began to be explored with sharper objectivity. This long process of coping with the past grew to underpin a new, self-effacing German national identity. Angela Merkel, the chancellor from 2005 to 2021, cemented the sense of a special responsibility to Israel by stressing that its security is a part of Germany’s own “reason of state”. In 2019, ironically at the instigation of the Alternative for Germany (<small>A</small>f<small>D</small>), a party widely shunned as fascistic, German legislators adopted a motion that equated calls to boycott Israel with antisemitism. </p><p class="article__body-text">This official conflation, identifying opposition to Israeli policy with hostility to Jews in general, spread more widely with the appointment of government “antisemitism commissioners”. Organisations that rely on state funding, which in Germany means a very large proportion, have found themselves increasingly scrutinised over suspicions that they might cross this bureaucracy’s vaguely defined lines. The fear of budget cuts or public ostracism—the underlying cause of the rash of cancellations cited above—is not misplaced, as Oyoun, a cultural centre in Berlin, discovered in November. The city abruptly severed funding for the venue after it hosted a pro-peace Jewish <small>NGO </small>that one culture commissioner thought might encourage “hidden forms” of antisemitism.</p><p class="article__body-text">The horror of Gaza, where Israeli forces have now killed more than 18 times as many people as Hamas’s terrorists killed on October 7th, has exposed the awkwardness of Germany’s one-sided embrace of Israel, but also placed Germany’s Jews in a quandary. Some fear that official over-protectiveness could itself provoke an anti-Jewish backlash. By contrast Wieland Hoban, a Frankfurt-based composer and Jewish activist, suggests that being told by the German establishment “how to be Jews” could itself be called antisemitic. </p><p class="article__body-text">But perhaps the advice delivered at a Berlin seminar in December by Alon-Lee Green, an Israeli activist, is easier for Germans to understand. If you really want to act as a good friend to Israel, he said, criticism is fine. When a friend is drunk you don’t give them another drink. You take them home and put them to bed. ■</p></div></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/europe/"><span>Europe</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Get them while they’re young</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">The simmering row over Spanish-language teaching in Catalan schools</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Now fuelled by a poor result in the latest PISA educational tests </h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_EUP002.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">W</span><small>HEN THE PISA</small> worldwide educational comparisons came out late in 2023, most countries fell to wondering how to do better.

But students in Catalonia lost even more, and native Spanish-speakers did worse than Catalan-speakers to boot—a failing critics were quick to pin on language policy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In the 1980s Catalonia began a transition to teaching all subjects in Catalan, except Spanish. Several years ago the region’s top court ruled that at least 25% of classes must be given in Spanish.

And so they petitioned the European Parliament to investigate what they call a violation of pupils’ basic rights. The week before Christmas a delegation made a fact-finding trip. The Catalan education secretary says they came having already made up their minds that the region’s language policy harms pupils’ performance. She blames child poverty, which is above the European average.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In the Escola San Jaume, a primary school in El Prat de Llobregat, a heavily Spanish-speaking town near Barcelona, all signs are in Catalan. Only about 10% of the pupils are native Catalan-speakers, says the director, Arturo Ramírez. A pupil who asks a question in Spanish is gently encouraged to try in Catalan, but children may speak to each other in Spanish in class—as they overwhelmingly do in breaks. Everyone eventually learns both languages, Mr Ramírez says.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Indeed, that is the stated goal of both his school and that of the <small>AEB</small>: fluency in Spanish and Catalan. Despite the never-ending dispute across Spain, it is one largely achieved in Catalonia, where over 80% of the population speaks and reads Catalan, and everyone barring some immigrants speaks Spanish too.

The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has cruelly reminded Europe that, for all its talk of geopolitical clout, it is not treated in the region as an indispensable interlocutor. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, was made to wait in his plane on the tarmac in Doha recently for 30 minutes until a Qatari minister turned up to welcome him. In December his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, had to scale back a would-be regional Middle East tour to just two Gulf cities. Britain and France have each sent naval vessels to the eastern Mediterranean, but this gesture has barely registered. For all such efforts and more besides, if and when Israel silences the guns in Gaza, it will not be thanks to the Europeans.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In some respects this should come as no surprise. As its closest friend and supplier of arms, America is the only Western power with proper influence in Israel. In the region it is Qatar and Egypt that have a line to Hamas. Europe’s voice is not only marginal, but discordant. In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7th, Europeans paraded their differences with a procession of unco-ordinated visits. Germany’s history keeps it close to Israel. Spain has angered Israel with its pro-Palestinian leanings. When in December America voted against an emergency United Nations resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, Britain and Germany abstained; France voted in favour.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Moreover, what Europeans lack in unity they do not always make up for in clarity. In countries with big Muslim and Jewish populations national leaders are treading a perilous line, wary of inflaming inter-communal tensions at home. Many try not to take sides, even as they harden their words in the face of the devastation in Gaza. Complexity engenders confusion.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Take the example of France as a good way to encapsulate the problem. After terrorists struck Paris in 2015, the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority joined a march in the French capital in a symbolic display of international support. When Mr Macron flew to Israel in October, keen to show reciprocal solidarity, he initially called for nothing less than an international “coalition” against Hamas, based on the one set up to fight Islamic State. Weeks later, as the shells rained down, he was telling Israel to stop bombing women and children, and called for a ceasefire.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">French diplomats wind a heroic thread from one presidential position to the other. At the outset, they point out, Mr Macron did also urge Israel to respect international law and spare civilians, and restated French support for a Palestinian state (which is true). There is no inherent contradiction between supporting Israel’s right to defend itself against terrorism and calling for restraint in how that right is exercised (which is also true). Yet the perception that the French president initially tilted too far in Israel’s direction took hold, including among some of his own ambassadors. By the end of 2023 Mr Macron emerged as one of Europe’s more outspoken critics of the way Israel is waging war in Gaza.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Such a shift in tone, prompted by a mix of indignation and concern about the radicalisation of a new generation of Palestinians, is now to be heard in many of Europe’s chancelleries. Britain and Germany, staunch allies of Israel, have both also called for a ceasefire, albeit one they call “sustainable” rather than “immediate”. Europeans seem to be converging on a note of public censure. Yet even so they are up against the limits of declarative diplomacy. The sad truth is that their voice does not carry in the region.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The agony of inaudibility is felt both by national leaders and those who run Europe’s Brussels-based institutions. It is acutely frustrating for France, where nostalgia lingers for the days when its traditional “Arab” foreign policy secured the country a certain stature in the region. In 1974 France, unlike America and Britain, voted to invite the Palestine Liberation Organisation to take part in relevant meetings at the <small>UN</small>. When Jacques Chirac was president in the mid-1990s, under a very different world order, he was mobbed by enthusiastic crowds on the streets of Ramallah, in the West Bank. Later, France’s opposition to the American-led invasion of Iraq earned it credibility across the Arab Levant. France still sees itself as a useful power in the region, allied to America but not bound by it, and one that can speak to all. Yet today an awkward gap has opened up between a hugely energetic diplomatic effort on the one hand and a frustratingly meagre return on the other.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">The voice</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Does inaudibility render the European effort futile? Not necessarily. The French, for one, have no illusions about what they alone can achieve. Those close to Mr Macron talk about the country being a “facilitator”, rather than a decisive intermediary. International pressure, if co-ordinated, still counts for something. Some Arab officials invoke in private the early French call for a ceasefire, if only in order to put pressure on the Americans to do the same. Moreover, Europeans get a hearing of sorts by sending medicine, tents, generators and food to Gaza, as they have long done. In Lebanon, where France has historic ties, a line to Hizbullah and hundreds of soldiers in the <small>UN</small> peacekeeping force, the French (along with the British) are working with the Americans to try to contain the conflict in the country’s south. Boots on the ground there secure a seat at the table.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">If the war in Gaza has exposed the limits to European ambition, it has done so just as Russia’s war on Ukraine has revealed the bloc can stay relatively united, and make a difference. Therein lies a thought for 2024. Gaza matters hugely. But Europeans are also dealing with an existential war on their own soil, emerging war fatigue, a stalemate on the ground and the prospect of America unplugging support in 2024. On this battlefield, Europe’s voice is not just audible but crucial. That is where its leaders should use it. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Read more from Charlemagne, our columnist on European politics: <br/></b></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/britain/"><span>Britain</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->The Great Rewiring</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Britain needs an unprecedented expansion of the electricity grid</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">That means a bigger role for the state, whoever wins the election</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_BRP001.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">F</span><small>or decades</small> the electricity grid—the mix of inverters, pylons, substations and transformers that connects sources of energy to consumers—has barely featured in British politics.

Britain’s grid has long been one of the most stable in the world, according to the World Bank. The British grid is also one of the world’s cleanest (see chart), emitting a third less carbon dioxide than the German grid did in 2022. “Liberalisation and privatisation have delivered the outcomes you want,” says Guy Newey, a former policy adviser who now runs Energy Systems Catapult, an outfit that helps startups.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But the grid’s days of quietly efficient obscurity are over. The demands of decarbonisation, needed to slow down climate change, have propelled it up the political agenda. The Conservatives have promised a grid whose operation causes no net emissions of carbon by 2035. Labour has pledged to do the same by 2030.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">That is an enormous undertaking. Renewable sources of power, such as wind turbines and solar panels, must be plugged into the grid; so must banks of batteries to smooth out variable supply. Britain must increase the amount of grid infrastructure that is built every year by a factor of seven, says Adam Bell, formerly the government’s head of energy strategy, now of Stonehaven, a consultancy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The current system is not equipped to meet this challenge. Regulatory processes are geared to slow and predictable change. In an independent review of the grid commissioned by the government and published in August, Nick Winser, an energy grandee, wrote that it currently takes between 12 and 14 years for new transmission lines to go from conception to being switched on. If this sort of sluggishness persists it will torpedo both parties’ grid ambitions, not to mention Britain’s hopes of meeting its climate targets.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It will also hurt the economy. Housing and data-centre developments are being held back by the lack of available connections; the queue of connection requests is gigantic. British electricity looks dear compared with neighbouring countries. “Reducing emissions comes after the economic benefits of solving the grid,” says Sam Alvis of Public First, a consultancy. “It’s the number one thing that British business needs to compete.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Some action is already being taken. On November 27th Ofgem, which regulates the electricity grid, changed the way it handles requests to connect. The old system was a first-come-first-served affair, in which everyone just waits their turn. A 1<small>GW</small> solar farm in the Midlands was recently added to the queue, with a connection date brushing up against 2040. The new rules introduce strict milestones for grid-connection projects—whether land rights have been secured, say—and give the grid operator, National Grid <small>ESO</small> (<small>NGESO</small>), the power to kill both new and existing requests which do not meet them. The idea is that this will eliminate speculative “zombie” projects, which bag a spot in the queue in order to be bought out.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mr Winser’s report made 18 recommendations to speed things up further. In one way or another they involve moving away from the case-by-case processes of identifying need, carrying out a preliminary design, gaining regulatory approval and planning permission, buying components and hiring workers. All grid infrastructure should be built according to a single plan, he concluded, with the government, regulators and grid operators united behind it. The state, in other words, needs to start playing a bigger role.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This shift is also under way, most obviously with the nationalisation of <small>NGESO</small>. The creation of the Future System Operator (<small>FSO</small>), as the new government-owned grid operator will be called, is one of the primary goals of the Energy Act that received royal assent in October. The government is due to buy the operator this year from National Grid, a private company which builds and owns physical grid infrastructure. This is to avoid conflicts of interest as <small>NGESO</small> develops a countrywide plan for the transmission network to efficiently connect far-flung renewable generation with pools of mostly urban consumers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">If the Tories have already paved the way for greater government control of the grid, Labour would go further and faster. That is partly a matter of political economy. Labour is in a stronger position to ram through more electricity infrastructure because its own supporters are less affected by it. The plans being drawn up by <small>NGESO</small> for the future grid happen to require pylons to be run through just a single existing Labour seat, according to Mr Alvis. The party intends to increase the number of planning officers and to standardise environmental surveys so that a given project can gain consent faster.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">More radically, Labour also plans to set up a state-owned company called <small>GB</small> Energy. This will run a purchasing consortium for all buyers of grid gear, aping a successful Dutch system, in order to ensure that equipment is procured upfront and on time. Some of that gear, Labour hopes, will come from British factories.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>GB</small> Energy will also bid to construct some bits of grid infrastructure. Building seven times more grid every year requires a commensurate increase in investment; Labour sees this as its only way to have a net-zero grid by 2030. It is a goal, says Andrew Sissons, a former policy official now at Nesta, a charity focused on innovation, that implies an “almost wartime effort”.</p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="National Grid engineers up a pylon.

This is a model the current government has used to build nuclear power plants, risky projects that attract high interest rates. In the same way <small>GB</small> Energy will probably try to bid on riskier and more expensive grid projects. If it wins these contracts, then the consequences could be material. “It is quite radical,” says Mr Sissons, “because it implies some partial nationalisation of the grid. Those new bits of grid infrastructure may end up in state hands.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Private operators hope that they will also be allowed to bid against National Grid and <small>GB</small> Energy to build lower-risk bits of the grid. Eclipse, an independent distribution network operator (<small>DNO</small>) owned by Octopus, a utility, thinks it could deploy £3bn ($3.8bn) of capital if it received a licence for transmission work.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">There are pitfalls aplenty here for Labour. The most obvious is that there is simply not much public money available for the kind of state-led activity it envisages. Under the current model, grid upgrades are paid for by energy consumers via bills. If the government ends up funding the construction of electricity infrastructure directly, via the exchequer, it will find it has a fiscal “tightrope” to walk, says Mr Sissons.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A second challenge is to ensure that the roles of all the state bodies are clear. “What is absolutely needed urgently is a very clear articulation of what is the responsibility of <small>FSO</small>, what is the responsibility of Ofgem and what is the responsibility of the government,” says Mr Newey. “A messy set of overlapping responsibilities could lead to finger-pointing.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The third looming problem is that distribution networks, which bring electricity over the last mile to consumers, are not yet part of any rewiring plan. <small>DNO</small>s do not have good systems for monitoring their networks and often know that they have reached capacity only when a substation blows out. This could lead to a situation where the transmission grid has been successfully decarbonised, but there is no way to plug in all the cars and heat pumps which use that clean electricity.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Current plans </h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The best way to minimise these risks is to maximise the amount of efficiency that can be squeezed from the existing grid. “The debate is about how much emphasis you put on building, and how much you put on flexibility, so you’re making the most of your system,” says Mr Newey. Flexibility would mean changing the way the electricity market is regulated to allow different prices to be charged to consumers on different parts of the grid.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">At the moment, for example, Scottish wind-farm operators are paid to switch off their turbines when the wind blows strongly because the grid does not have the capacity to send all the electricity they generate to consumers. “One answer to curtailed Scottish wind farms is to build loads of transmission to get it to the south of England,” says Mr Newey. But he thinks it would be better to have location-based pricing which both encourages generation to be built nearer demand centres and incentivises new sources of consumption, like factories, to be built where power is cheaper. Utilities like Octopus agree.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Labour believes that the task of rewiring Britain is important enough and urgent enough that public money and central planning are the only way to achieve it quickly. Even if Labour’s goal of making the grid net zero by 2030 is arbitrary, speed is undoubtedly necessary. But the risk is that state intervention dampens price signals, leaving Britain with an expensive, overbuilt grid. The costs of that would, as ever, end up being paid by consumers. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/britain/"><span>Britain</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Bowling over?</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Lawn bowls is in decline.

But there is another game—both older and, for much of its history, more popular—which fits the description better. In the 14th century lawn bowling, a sport in which players roll large balls towards a smaller one (the “jack”), was so popular that it kept soldiers from their archery practice. Henry VIII was one of several monarchs to ban it, at least for the lower classes (a keen bowler, he continued to play).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">British players still dominate in lawn bowls at the <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/07/29/what-is-the-point-of-the-commonwealth-games">Commonwealth games</a> (where it has been a “core sport” since the event was launched in 1930). Lush and meticulously tended bowling greens continue to dot Britain; many clubs serve as community hubs. But the game now has a different sort of popularity problem. As Britons have found more ways to fill their leisure time, club memberships have fallen. Closures have followed.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">No one knows precisely how many bowling greens Britain has left—there may be around 7,000—but Hugh Hornby, a sports historian, painted a melancholy picture in “Bowled Over”, a book published in 2015. Between 1959 and 2015 the number of bowling clubs in Middlesex, a historic county swallowed up by London, fell from 242 to 94. In nearby Surrey the number dropped from 311 to 137. If losses continued at that rate, Hornby wrote, bowls would disappear from Britain by 2050.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This decline is worth noting if only because of the role the game has played in Britain’s social and cultural history. A recognisable version of the modern game was established by 1500. The first rules were published in 1670, nearly a century before those for cricket and golf were codified. Shakespeare alluded to bowling a lot; so did Samuel Pepys. In 1618 Nicholas Breton, a poet, wrote that a gentleman should “speake well, ride well, shoote well and bowle well”. That view was reflected in the design of many country-house gardens, the strikingly level lawns of which were once bowling greens.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Bowls England, the national governing body, does not want bowls to become history. In 2021 it launched a five-year plan, “Fit for the Future”, to attract new players. Its advertising campaigns point out that the game is easy to learn (although it is hard to master) and doesn’t require any athleticism. That arguably makes it a little dull to all but the very old or infirm. Seeking to attract younger players, in 2022 Bowls England launched a newer, faster version of the game dubbed, with a hint of desperation, Bowls Bash.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Yet the gentle exercise the game provides, coupled with the presence of clubs in villages, towns and cities, ought to make bowls the perfect game for an ageing (and increasingly unhealthy) population. Some clubs report that many of their new members join their ranks after golf becomes a bit too much.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Residents of Brixton, a diverse neighbourhood in south London, recall how the bowling club in the local park held impromptu games, to which strangers were welcomed, on summer evenings. Some games took place in a haze of marijuana smoke—Bowls Hash, perhaps. But park greens, which are maintained by local authorities, are particularly vulnerable to closure. A service that attracts relatively few users (Bowls England reckons that 20% of clubs have fewer than 20 members) yet requires careful maintenance (the kinds of large lawnmowers used on football pitches don’t cut it) is an obvious target for council bean-counters.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A few years ago the local authority stopped maintaining the green in Brixton for bowls. Today, its grass gone, the green is brown. It is used, variously, as a practice ground for volleyball and a football pitch by children. In a crowded city, that feels a bit like progress. But for one of the country’s historic sporting pastimes, it tells a bleaker story. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/britain/"><span>Britain</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Poll exploration</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Older British voters still favour the Tories.

Just 18% of voters aged between 18 and 34 say the same. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/britain/"><span>Britain</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Bagehot</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">What Britain’s Labour Party thinks of Europe</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Rachel Reeves is heir to a long Labour history of ambivalence towards the EU </h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_BRD000.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">R</span><small>ACHEL REEVES</small> can surprise visitors by her coldness towards Europe. At a recent dinner the shadow chancellor was asked when Britain would rejoin the European Union. A naive question, met with a blunt response. “No, no, no! You don’t get it!” she said, according to one who was there. Ms Reeves voted to remain in 2016; in the deadlock that followed she reluctantly supported a second referendum. But, she told her fellow diners, her constituents in Leeds had seen local factories advertising for workers in Poland; lifelong Labour voters had come out for Brexit in their droves. “The constitutional question is closed.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Plenty think that is just a practised feint from a former junior chess champion. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has packed his shadow cabinet with second-referendists. Many Labour voters would cheer a reintegration with the <small>EU</small>: 78% of them think divorce was a mistake. Brexit is a drag on growth, the party’s proclaimed number-one priority. In opposition, the Labour Party is proposing only modest tweaks to Britain’s <small>EU</small> trade deal. If elected later this year, will they not yearn for Brussels’s embrace?</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The short answer is “no”. Ms Reeves represents the dominant strand of thinking in the Labour Party: not Europhilia, but Euro-agnosticism. The binary choice imposed by the Brexit referendum masked older Labour instincts on Europe: ambivalence, indifference and suspicion. In government, these instincts will prevail.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Electoral strategy demands Euro-agnosticism. Leavers may be a minority of Labour’s electorate but they predominate in the places it lost in the rout of 2019, and on which the Starmer project is singularly focused. When activists ask why, given Labour’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/uk-general-election/polls">poll lead</a>, it can’t be bolder about Europe, Ms Reeves rebukes their complacency. The party loses too often, she argues, to alienate a wing of its support. Voters’ identities as Leavers and Remainers persist; you stir them up at your peril.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">And in Ms Reeves’s telling, Leave voters had a point. In a pamphlet in 2018 she argued that the <small>EU’</small>s single market, and the free movement of labour it brought, were part of four decades of globalisation which caused fissures in Labour’s electoral coalition. Labour-supporting urban professionals prospered from cross-border services; its socially conservative working-class heartlands got only low-wage migration, low investment and the spectre of “the redundancy of its way of life”. Labour could circumvent such folk, she wrote, and squeak into power with a “progressive alliance”. But that “would bring to an end Labour’s historic role as the party of working people. And what then would be its purpose?”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">As a result, Labour is Euro-agnostic on economics. Out with what Ms Reeves terms the “hyper-globalisation” of the New Labour era; in with industrial subsidies, shortened supply chains and “Buy British” policies, framed by the rhetoric of resilience, security and a “home-grown” economy. This vision is not incompatible with <small>EU </small>membership. But it casts the liberalising force of the single market as yesterday’s thinking and as a distraction from much older problems in the British economy. Sir Keir these days dismisses the European question as an intellectual “warm bath”. His shadow chancellor argues that a party which promises investors stability can hardly re-litigate the paralysing Brexit debates.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">While Tories still obsess about the <small>EU</small>, in other words, Labour doesn’t think about it much at all. The party’s blueprint to decarbonise electricity—a project ripe for co-operation—makes no mention of Europe other than to gripe about foreign ownership of British wind farms. Few of the shadow cabinet are familiar with Brussels. Labour <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/09/28/britains-labour-party-takes-lessons-from-joe-biden">looks across the Atlantic</a>, to the Democrats, for ideas. The typical party member voted to remain but is more animated by poverty and the health service.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Europe is foreign policy, not destiny. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, sees Britain as an active power in a concentric Europe, with new security treaties and regular summits. The ambition reflects internationalism more than integrationism; the <small>EU</small> is spoken of in the same breath as aid and climate diplomacy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">All of which accords with a long history of Labour Euro-agnosticism. “I don’t stand on the south coast, look towards the continent and say ‘There’s the new Jerusalem’,” declared Harold Wilson, a Labour prime minister who called Britain’s first referendum on Europe in 1975. James Callaghan, his successor, thought it a handy commercial “instrument” but not a vision like the empire. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader in the 2015 election, put Labour on a course towards an in-out referendum, albeit on a slower timetable than David Cameron’s (at the next <small>EU</small> treaty change, rather than by 2017). He and Lord Cameron shared a nitpicky critique of Brussels: too bossy, too expensive, too many migrants.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">She’s just not that into EU</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Can a party that has promised the fastest growth in the <small>G</small>7 afford to be ambivalent about Britain’s largest trading partner? Some around the party muse that a radical rethink of the relationship would be a project for Labour to pursue during a second term. But Euro-agnosticism can breed naivety about other European leaders’ appetite for a new deal with Britain. It would require of Labour hard diplomatic graft, a willingness to spend political capital and a vision that is currently lacking. It would also mean grappling with the <small>EU</small>’s constitutional glue: the writ of the European Court of Justice, the supervision of the commission and so on. Labour <small>MP</small>s flinch at that. They are not sovereignty-fetishists but they are creatures of Westminster, at home with parliamentary supremacy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A first Labour term is likely to yield a few worthwhile improvements in the relationship with the <small>EU</small>—shaving paperwork for food products, school visits and the like. The day may come when it sees no alternative to a pitch for serious reintegration. But the strictures entailed by that would not be sold as crowning achievements of a European project. They would be the price to be paid, reluctantly and without fanfare, for a higher standard of living. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Read more from Bagehot, our columnist on British politics: <br/></b></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/business/"><span>Business</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Machine of the state</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Welcome to the era of AI nationalism</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Sovereigns the world over are racing to control their technological destinies</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_WBD001.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>he hottest</small> technology of 2023 had a busy last few weeks of the year.

On December 11th Mistral, a seven-month-old French <small>AI</small> startup, announced a blockbuster $400m funding round, which insiders say will value the firm at over $2bn. Four days later Krutrim, a new Indian startup, unveiled India’s first multilingual <small>LLM</small>, barely a week after Sarvam, a five-month-old one, raised $41m to build similar Indian-language models.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="1462" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_WBC833.png" srcset="../image/20240106_WBC833.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Ever since <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/22/the-fallout-from-the-weirdness-at-openai">Open<small>AI</small></a>, an American firm, launched Chat<small>GPT</small>, its humanlike conversationalist, in November 2022, just about every month has brought a flurry of similar news.

In the past year their governments have pledged $40bn-50bn apiece for <small>AI</small> investments. Other countries do not want to be left behind—or stuck with a critical technology that is under foreign control. In 2023 another six particularly <small>AI</small>-ambitious governments around the world—Britain, France, Germany, India, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (<small>UAE</small>)—promised to bankroll <small>AI</small> to the collective tune of around $40bn (see chart). Most of this will go towards purchases of <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/05/29/nvidia-is-not-the-only-firm-cashing-in-on-the-ai-gold-rush">graphics-processing units</a> (<small>GPU</small>s, the type of chips used to train <small>AI</small> models) and factories to make such chips, as well as, to a lesser extent, support for <small>AI</small> firms. The nature and degree of state involvement varies from one wannabe <small>AI</small> superpower to another. It is early days, but the contours of new <small>AI</small>-industrial complexes are emerging.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Start with America, whose tech firms give everyone else <small>AI</small> envy. Its vibrant private sector is innovating furiously without direct support from Uncle Sam. Instead, the federal government is spending around $50bn over five years to <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/08/07/how-real-is-americas-chipmaking-renaissance">increase domestic chipmaking capacity</a>. The idea is to reduce America’s reliance on Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers such as <small>TSMC</small>, the world’s biggest and most sophisticated such company. Supplies from Taiwan could, fear security hawks in Washington, be imperilled if China decided to <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/11/06/invading-taiwan-would-be-a-logistical-minefield-for-china">invade the island</a>, which it considers part of its territory.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Another way America intends to stay ahead of the pack is by <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/29/america-takes-on-china-with-a-giant-microchips-bill">nobbling rivals</a>. President Joe Biden’s administration has enacted brutal export controls that ban the sale of cutting-edge <small>AI</small> technology, including chips and chipmaking equipment, to adversaries such as China and Russia. It has also barred Americans from sharing their <small>AI</small> expertise with those countries.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It is now coercing those on the geopolitical fence to fall in line. In October the American government started requiring companies in third countries, including Saudi Arabia and the <small>UAE</small>, to secure a licence in order to buy <small>AI</small> chips from Nvidia, an American firm that sells most of them. The rules have a “presumption of approval”. That means the government will “probably allow” sales to such firms, says Gregory Allen, who used to work on <small>AI</small> policy at the Department of Defence—as long, that is, as they do not have close ties to China. On December 6th Xiao Peng, who runs a state-backed <small>AI</small> startup in Abu Dhabi called <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/04/can-sino-arabian-business-ties-replace-sino-american-ones"><small>G</small>42</a>, announced that the company would be cutting ties with Chinese hardware suppliers such as Huawei, a Chinese electronics company.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">China’s <small>AI</small> strategy is in large part a response to American techno-containment. According to data from <small>JW</small> Insights, a research firm, between 2021 and 2022 the Chinese state spent nearly $300bn to recreate the chip supply chain (for <small>AI</small> and other semiconductors) at home, where it would be immune from Western sanctions. A lot of that money is probably wasted. But it almost certainly helped Huawei and <small>SMIC</small>, China’s biggest chipmaker, to design and manufacture a surprisingly sophisticated <small>GPU</small> last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The central and local authorities also channel capital into <small>AI</small> firms through state-backed “guidance funds”, nearly 2,000 of which around the country invest in all manner of technologies deemed to be strategically important. The Communist Party is guiding private money, too, towards its technological priorities. Often it does so by cracking down on certain sectors—most recently, in December, <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/12/26/china-is-shoring-up-the-great-firewall-for-the-ai-age">video-gaming</a>—while dropping heavy hints about which <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/04/the-communist-party-wants-a-bit-less-consumer-internet">industries investors</a> should be looking at instead. The government is also promoting data exchanges, where businesses can trade commercial data on everything from sales to production, allowing small firms with <small>AI</small> ambitions to compete where previously only large data-rich firms could. There are already 50 such exchanges in China.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Elements of this state-led approach are being emulated in other parts of the world, notably in the Gulf’s petrostates. Being autocracies, Saudi Arabia and the <small>UAE </small>can move faster than democratic governments, which must heed voters’ concerns about <small>AI</small>’s impact on things like privacy and jobs. Being wealthy, they can afford both the <small>GPU</small>s (on which the two countries have together so far splurged several hundred million dollars) and the energy needed to run the power-hungry chips.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">They can also plough money into developing human capital. Their richly endowed universities are quickly climbing up global rankings. The <small>AI</small> programme at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia and the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (<small>MBZUAI</small>) in Abu Dhabi, the world’s first <small>AI</small>-focused school, have poached star professors from illustrious institutions such as the University of California, Berkeley, and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Many of their students and researchers come from China. And plenty stick around. Nearly all of <small>MBZUAI</small>’s graduates, who number a couple of hundred, stay in the region to work at local firms and labs, says its provost, Timothy Baldwin (himself lured to the Middle East from the University of Melbourne).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The Gulf approach is producing results. The capabilities of the Falcon model, first built by a team of 20 or so engineers, rival those of Llama 2, the most widely used “open-source” model, devised by Meta, an American tech giant. <small>AI</small>71 plans to improve its open-source models using national datasets from fields including health, education and, some day, perhaps oil. “In the last 50 years, oil drove the country…now data is the new oil,” says Mr al-Bannai.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">The alignment problem</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A third group of governments is combining elements of America’s approach with those of the Chinese and Emiratis. The <small>EU</small> has its version of America’s incentives for domestic chipmaking. So do some member states: Germany is footing a third of the €30bn ($33bn) bill for a new chip factory to be built there by Intel, an American chipmaker. Outside the bloc, <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/15/how-britain-can-become-an-ai-superpower">Britain</a> has promised to funnel £1bn ($1.3bn) over five years to <small>AI</small> and supercomputing (albeit without going into detail about how exactly the money will be spent). India’s government is promoting manufacturing, including of semiconductors, with generous “production-linked incentives”, encouraging big cloud-computing providers to build more Indian data centres, where <small>AI</small> models are trained, and thinking about buying $1.2bn-worth of <small>GPU</small>s.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Like China and the Gulf but unlike America, where federal and state governments are reluctant to part with public data, India and some European countries are keen on making such data available to firms. France’s government “has been very supportive” in that regard, says Arthur Mensch, Mistral’s boss. Britain’s is considering allowing firms to tap rich data belonging to the National Health Service. India’s government has enormous amounts of data from its array of digital public services, known as the “India Stack”. Insiders expect it eventually to integrate Indian <small>AI</small> models into those digital services.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In contrast to China, which regulates consumer-facing <small>AI</small> with a heavy hand, at least for the time being Britain, France, Germany and India favour light-touch rules for <small>AI</small> or, in India’s case, none at all. The French and German governments have soured on the <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/10/europe-a-laggard-in-ai-seizes-the-lead-in-its-regulation"><small>EU</small>’s <small>AI</small> Act</a>, the final details of which are being hotly debated in Brussels—no doubt because it could constrain Mistral and Aleph Alpha, Germany’s most successful model-builder, which raised €460m in November.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It is natural for countries to want some control over what may prove to be a transformational technology. Especially in sensitive and highly regulated sectors such as defence, banking or <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/19/how-to-make-britains-health-service-ai-ready">health care</a>, many governments would rather not rely on imported <small>AI</small>. Yet each flavour of <small>AI</small> nationalism also carries risk.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">America’s beggar-thy-neighbour approach is likely to upset not just its adversaries but also some allies. China’s heavy regulation may offset some of the potential gains from its heavy spending. Building models for local languages, as Krutrim and Sarvam in India plan to do, may prove futile if foreign models continue to improve their multilingual capabilities. The Gulf’s bet on open-source models may misfire if other governments limit their use, as Mr Biden has hinted at in a recent executive order and the <small>EU</small> could do through its <small>AI</small> Act, out of fear that open <small>LLM</small>s could be put to malign uses by mischief-makers. Saudi and Emirati institutions may struggle to hold on to talent; a developer who worked on Falcon admits it greatly benefited from a partnership with a French team of engineers who have since been poached by Hugging Face, a high-flying Silicon Valley <small>AI</small> startup. As one sceptical investor notes, it is not yet clear how vast or useful public Emirati data actually is.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">As Nathan Benaich of Air Street Capital, a venture-capital firm, sums it up, most efforts to create national models “are probably a waste of money”. Mr Benaich’s warning is unlikely to dissuade <small>AI</small>-curious governments, mindful of the rewards should they succeed, from meddling. Mr Macron will not be the only leader to greet it with a Gallic shrug. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/business/"><span>Business</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Bartleby</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">A new year’s message from the CEO</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Up the permavucalution!</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_WBD003.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">D</span><small>ear friends</small> and colleagues,Happy New Year!

Muhammad bin Salman, its crown prince and de facto ruler, would like this to change. He wants half of Saudi electricity to come from wind and solar farms by 2030. Two-thirds of that capacity, or around 40 gigawatts (<small>GW</small>) will, if Prince Muhammad gets his wish (as he tends to do), be courtesy of one firm: <small>ACWA</small> Power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For most of its 19-year existence the utility was a relatively anonymous family-run affair.

Its newish boss, Marco Arcelli, a seasoned Italian energy executive, expects assets it has a stake in to triple between now and 2030, to $250bn. Its projects will, he hopes, help create a broader domestic green-energy supply chain. “We are a big enabler,” he says.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>ACWA</small> has thrived as many other renewables operators around the world have struggled. Whereas those rivals are seeing the cost of projects soar as a result of rising interest rates, <small>ACWA</small> has received non-interest-bearing loans from the <small>PIF</small>, in addition to debt secured against individual projects and loans from banks to tide it over while it raises more equity capital and brings in partners. Access to easy money has allowed <small>ACWA</small> to expand capacity, while lowering costs for customers. This has helped make the levelised cost of Saudi solar energy, which takes into account both construction and operation of a power plant, among the lowest in the world.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Nevertheless, <small>ACWA</small>’s returns on domestic projects are low by global standards. Mr Arcelli is thus keen to take advantage of juicier ones on offer abroad. He is investing nearby (in Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Oman, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates) and farther afield (Azerbaijan, Morocco, South Africa and Uzbekistan). Two-fifths of <small>ACWA</small>’s overall capacity is to be found outside Saudi Arabia. It is also eyeing China, a highly competitive market but one where <small>ACWA</small> could, thinks Mr Arcelli, gain both scale and technology partners in the form of Chinese manufacturers of wind turbines and solar panels.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>ACWA</small> has its work cut out. To meet Prince Muhammad’s domestic goals for it, the company must add 6-7<small>GW</small> of capacity—equivalent to three or four big projects—every year for the rest of the decade. It currently has just 14<small>GW</small> at various stages of development. Managing fast expansion will require a laser focus on costs (those of its nascent hydrogen venture has already risen by 70% from initial estimates, to $8bn). It will also require more debt. In September <small>ACWA</small> was already sitting on $7bn of it, equivalent to seven times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. Such a ratio would be considered a red flag at most firms.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>ACWA</small> may yet rise to the challenge. It can count on the <small>PIF</small>’s deep pockets. And it is a fast learner; its domestic 1.5<small>GW</small> Sudair solar project may be fully up and running in just over two years, reckons Oliver Connor of Citigroup, a bank, brisk by industry standards. Mr Arcelli wants things to go faster still.

In December 2014  <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2014/12/04/sheikhs-v-shale">put an image on its cover</a> of both antagonists standing back to back, frowns on their faces and petrol pumps at the ready. It called the new economics of oil “Sheikhs v shale”. Missing from that picture were two companies that until then had been the biggest stalwarts of America’s oil industry, ExxonMobil and Chevron. Had they been pictured, the two crusty supermajors would probably be standing awkwardly on the sidelines, struggling to make sense of what was going on. At last, they are moving back to centre stage. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For much of the interim period the petrostates and the hardscrabble shale producers remained critical to the new oil order, though their tussle unfolded in strange ways. In 2016 the <small>OPEC</small> producers’ cartel joined forces with Russia to create <small>OPEC</small>+, which its autocratic masterminds hoped would let them control oil prices in order to benefit their regimes. Yet instead of responding by dousing the world in oil, the frackers unexpectedly developed <small>OPEC</small>-like self-restraint. Under pressure from investors to improve profits, they kept a tight rein on drilling activity even when crude surged above $100 a barrel.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">That unusual discipline continued until 2023, when American producers awoke from their chaste slumber. Record shale output allowed America to extract more oil than any country in history, offsetting desperate efforts by <small>OPEC</small>+ to curtail production in order to prop up prices. According to <small>S</small>&amp;<small>P</small> Global, a consultancy, America and Canada together pumped more oil and gas in 2023 than the whole of the Middle East. The bonanza spread to South America, where producers in Brazil and Guyana also drilled unprecedented amounts of oil. Daniel Yergin, an energy historian, calls it “the great rebalancing”—a historic shift of oil production away from the Gulf and towards the western hemisphere.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It is in this context that you should consider two recent megadeals: ExxonMobil’s $64.5bn merger with Pioneer Natural Resources, a fracking giant, and Chevron’s $60bn acquisition of Hess, an independent producer. Both acquisitions are aimed at regaining the clout in the oil industry that was once their birthright. Alone, neither firm is powerful enough to push around oil prices as <small>OPEC</small>+ tries to. But together, they can double down on production in the Americas in a way that represents a new challenge to the petrostates. Forget the scrappy frackers. It is the deep-pocketed, tech-savvy supermajors that the sheikhs should worry about.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The two firms look like the shrewdest operators in today’s oil markets. One reason is their focus on oil that is cheap to produce. This is likely to leave them in a good position when demand for the stuff eventually wanes amid the shift to cleaner energy. The two acquisitions give the duo access to abundant fresh resources. The Pioneer deal is a big bet on the future of shale. Once completed by mid-2024, it aims to double ExxonMobil’s production capacity in the shale-rich Permian Basin of West Texas to 1.3m barrels a day. This will rise to 2m barrels by 2027. By buying Hess, Chevron, too, gets better access to some shale acreage where, like its bigger rival, it hopes to boost production by applying advanced technology and financial muscle. The company believes that an even bigger prize is Hess’s oil assets developed in partnership with ExxonMobil off the coast of Guyana, the extraction of which is, in keeping with the times, not very carbon-intensive. Taken together, the western-hemisphere wagers give the two companies options regardless of oil’s precise future. Shale is “short-cycle” production that can be quickly flexed depending on the near-term vagaries of demand. Guyana is a longer-term project.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The second reason the supermajors are looking shrewd is by letting themselves be guided by the economics of oil rather than by energy geopolitics. Their aim is not to rig prices. It is to turn a profit whatever happens in the markets. They can achieve this by integrating exploration and production with downstream operations such as refining and distribution. Contrast that with Saudi Aramco, the biggest oil firm of all. Like ExxonMobil and Chevron, it is a model of American-style efficiency. But when it comes to output management, it is also at the mercy of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman’s desire to walk tall on the world stage.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Molecules v electrons </h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A third reason for the American firms’ bright prospects has to do with their decarbonisation strategies. Both refused to take climate change seriously for too long. But once they did, they chose to back clean-energy technologies such as carbon capture and storage and hydrogen production that fit well with their engineering skills in oil and gas. The dabbling by their European counterparts, such as Shell and <small>BP</small>, in the provision of low-carbon electricity has meanwhile proved tougher than expected.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Like everyone, the Americans remain hostages to fortune. Their shale exposure may deplete far sooner than they expect; forecasters already point to a decline in the number of drilling rigs as an ominous sign. In a worst-case (albeit unlikely) scenario, Venezuela may try to make good on its threat to seize oil-rich territory from Guyana, its neighbour, putting their assets there in jeopardy. Most serious, they may have disastrously miscalculated the speed of the energy transition, leaving them with oceans of stranded oil if demand collapses.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For now, though, they look more like old pros in an industry in the grip of upheaval. They know the value of focusing on profitable growth, of keeping their long-term options open and of sticking to their free-market guns. The sheikhs have long insisted that, whatever oil’s future, their access to abundant reserves will ensure they will be the last oilmen standing. America’s supermajors will not let that happen without a fight. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Read more from Schumpeter, our columnist on global business:<br/></b></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/finance-and-economics/"><span>Finance and economics</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Paths to prosperity</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">How to get rich in the 21st century</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">The race to become the next economic superpower </h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_FND001.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">B</span><small>y 2050 there</small> will be a new crop of economic powers—if things go to plan. <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/14/modis-one-india-goal-is-good-for-the-economy-but-not-for-politics">Narendra Modi</a>, India’s prime minister, wants his country’s <small>GDP</small> per person to surpass the World Bank’s high-income threshold three years before then. Indonesia’s leaders reckon that they have until the mid-century mark, when an ageing population will start to drag on growth, to <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2023/03/29/which-will-grow-faster-india-or-indonesia">catch up</a> with rich countries. The middle of the century is also the ultimate finale for many of Muhammad bin Salman’s “Vision 2030” reforms. Saudi Arabia’s crown prince wants to <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/the-reinvention-of-the-saudi-economy-is-going-slower-than-planned/21806192">transform his country</a> from an oil producer into a diversified economy. Other smaller countries, including Chile, Ethiopia and Malaysia, have schemes of their own.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">These vary widely, but all have something in common: breathtaking ambition. India’s officials think that <small>GDP </small>growth of 8% a year will be required to meet Mr Modi’s goal—1.5 percentage points more than the country has managed on average over the past three decades. Indonesia will need growth of 7% a year, up from an average of 4.6% over the same period. Saudi Arabia’s non-oil economy will have to grow by 9% a year, up from an average of 2.8%. Although 2023 was a good year for all three, none experienced growth at this sort of pace. Very few countries have maintained such growth for five years, let alone for 30.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Nor is there an obvious recipe for runaway growth. To boost prosperity, economists typically prescribe liberalising reforms of the sort that have been advanced by the <small>IMF </small>and the World Bank since the 1980s under the label of the “Washington consensus”. Among the most widely adopted are sober fiscal policies and steady exchange rates. Today technocrats urge looser competition rules and the privatisation of state-owned firms. Yet these proposals are ultimately concerned with removing barriers to growth, rather than supercharging it. Indeed, William Easterly of New York University has calculated that, even among the 52 countries which had policies most consistent with the Washington consensus, <small>GDP </small>growth only averaged 2% a year from 1980 to 1998. Mr Modi and Prince Muhammad are unwilling to wait—they want to develop, fast.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The aim is to achieve the sort of meteoric growth that East Asian countries managed in the 1970s and 1980s. As globalisation spread, they made the most of large and cheap workforces, gaining an edge in markets for cars (Japan), electronics (South Korea) and pharmaceuticals (Singapore). Industries were built behind protectionist walls, which restricted imports, then thrived when trade with the rest of the world was encouraged. Foreign companies later brought the know-how and capital required to churn out more complex and profitable goods, increasing productivity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Little surprise, then, that leaders across the developing world remain enthusiastic about manufacturing. In 2015 Mr Modi announced plans to increase industry’s share of Indian <small>GDP </small>to 25%, from 16%. “Sell anywhere, but make in India,” he urged business leaders. Cambodia hopes to double the exports of its factories, excluding clothing, by 2025. Kenya wants to see its manufacturing sector grow by 15% a year.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">There is a snag, however. Industrialisation is even more difficult to induce than it was 40 or 50 years ago. As a result of technological advances, fewer workers than ever are needed to produce, say, a pair of socks. In India five times fewer workers were required to operate a factory in 2007 than in 1980. Across the world, industry now runs on skill and capital, which rich countries have in abundance, and less on labour, meaning that a large, cheap workforce no longer offers much of a route to economic development. Mr Modi and others therefore have a new game plan: they want to leap ahead to cutting-edge manufacturing. Why bother stitching socks when you can etch semiconductors?</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="626" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_FNC876.png" srcset="../image/20240106_FNC876.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This “extraordinary obsession with making stuff right on the technological frontier”, as a former adviser to the Indian government puts it, sometimes leads to old-fashioned protectionism. Indian companies may be welcome to sell anywhere, but Mr Modi wants Indians to buy Indian. He has announced import bans on everything from laptops to weapons.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But not all the protectionism is old-fashioned. Since the last outbreak in India, in the 1970s, subsidies and tax breaks have mostly replaced import bans and licensing. Back then every investment above a certain threshold had to be cleared by a civil servant. Now senior officials are under orders from Mr Modi to drum up $100bn-worth of investment a year, and the prime minister has declared luring chipmakers to be among his main economic goals. “Production-linked incentives” give tax breaks for each computer or missile made in the country, as well as for other high-tech products. In 2023 such subsidies carried a bill of $45bn, or 1.2% of <small>GDP</small>, up from $8bn or so when the scheme was launched three years earlier. Similarly, Malaysia is offering handouts to firms that establish cloud-computing operations, and helps with the cost of factories set up in the country. Kenya is building five tax-free industrial parks, which will be ready in 2030, and has plans for another 20.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="626" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_FNC875.png" srcset="../image/20240106_FNC875.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In some places, there has been early success. Cambodia’s manufacturing sector produced three percentage points more of the country’s <small>GDP </small>last year than it did five years ago. Firms that are looking to diversify from China have been lured by low costs, subsidies for high-tech manufacturing and state investment. Elsewhere, though, things are proving harder. In India manufacturing has stayed steady as a share of <small>GDP</small>—Mr Modi is not going to hit his 25% target by next year. Big names like Apple and Tesla have put their brands on a factory or two, but show little desire to make the sort of investments they once lavished on China, which offers superior infrastructure and a better-educated workforce.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The danger is that, in seeking to attract high-tech manufacturing, countries end up repeating past disasters. From 1960 to 1991 manufacturing’s share of Indian <small>GDP </small>doubled. But when protective barriers were removed in the 1990s, nothing was cheap enough to export to the rest of the world. The risk is especially great this time around since Mr Modi sees manufacturing as being synonymous with “self-reliance”—or India’s ability to produce everything that it needs, especially the tech that goes into weapons. Along with Indonesia and Turkey, India is one of a group of countries that view getting rich as route to a stronger geopolitical position, increasing the chance of misdirected investment.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Green thumb</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">These drawbacks to both basic manufacturing and attempts to leap ahead are helping convince some countries to try another approach: attracting industries that use their natural resources, especially the metals and minerals powering the green transition. Governments in Latin America are keen. So are the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe. But it is Indonesia that is leading the way, and doing so with striking heavy-handedness. Since 2020 the country has banned exports of bauxite and nickel, of which it produces 7% and 22% of global supply. Officials hope that by keeping a tight grip they can get refiners to move to the country. They then want to repeat the trick, persuading each stage of the supply chain to follow, until Indonesian workers are making everything from battery components to wind turbines.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Officials are also offering carrots, in the form of both cash and facilities. Indonesia is in the midst of an infrastructure boom: spending between 2020 to 2024 ought to reach $400bn, over 50% more a year than in 2014. This includes funding for at least 27 multibillion-dollar industrial parks, including the Kalimantan Park, constructed on 13,000 hectares of former Bornean rainforest at a cost of $129bn. Other countries are also offering sweeteners. Firms that want to install solar panels in Brazil will receive subsidies to also build them there. Bolivia nationalised its lithium industry, but its new state-owned conglomerates will be permitted to enter into joint ventures with Chinese companies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This approach—of trying to scale the energy supply chain—has little precedent. The world’s oiliest countries mostly ship their crude abroad. Indeed, more than 40% of global refining capacity can be found in America, China, India and Japan. Saudi Arabia refines less than a quarter of what it produces; Saudi Aramco, its state oil giant, refines in northern China. Experiments with export bans have mostly been in simpler commodities, such as timber in Ghana and tea in Tanzania. By contrast, obtaining nickel pure enough to be used in electric vehicles from Indonesia’s supply is ferociously complex, notes Matt Geiger of <small>MJG </small>Capital, a hedge fund. Doing so requires three different types of factory, and the nickel must then pass through several more before it enters a car.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Fossil fuels have made parts of the Gulf rich, but almost every industry in the world constantly guzzles oil. There is no guarantee that the bonanza from green metals will be anywhere near as large. Batteries only need replacing every few years. Officials at the International Energy Agency, a global body, reckon that pay-offs from green commodities will peak in the next few years, after which they will taper off. Moreover, technological development could suddenly reduce appetite for certain metals (say, if another type of battery chemistry becomes dominant).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Meanwhile, fossil-fuel beneficiaries are trying another strategy altogether: to reinvent the entrepot. The Gulf wants to be where the world does business, welcoming trade from all corners of the globe and providing shelter from geopolitical tensions, particularly between America and China. By 2050 the world should have reached net-zero emissions. Although the Gulf is rich, its economies are still developing. Local workforces are less skilled than those in Malaysia, yet receive wages comparable to those in Spain. This makes foreign workers essential. In Saudi Arabia they account for three-quarters of the total labour force.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="626" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_FNC836.png" srcset="../image/20240106_FNC836.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The United Arab Emirates (<small>uae</small>) was one of the first countries in the region to diversify. It has focused on industries, such as shipping and tourism, that may help to facilitate other business, as well as on high-tech industries, such as <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/01/welcome-to-the-era-of-ai-nationalism">artificial intelligence</a> (<small>AI</small>) and chemicals. Abu Dhabi is already home to outposts of the Louvre and New York University, and has plans to make money from space travel for tourists. Qatar is building Education City, a campus that will cost $6.5bn and sprawl across 1,500 hectares, working a bit like an industrial park for universities, hosting the branches of ten, including Northwestern and University College London.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Others in the Gulf are also getting involved. Saudi Arabia hopes to see flows of foreign investment increase to 5.7% of <small>GDP </small>in 2030, up from 0.7% in 2022, and is spending fabulous amounts of money in pursuit of this ambition. The Public Investment Fund has disbursed $1.3trn in the country over the past decade—more than is forecast to be unleashed by the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s industrial policy in America. The fund is shelling out on everything from football teams and petrochemical plants to entirely new cities. Industrial policy has never been conducted on such a scale. Dani Rodrik of Harvard University and Nathaniel Lane of the University of Oxford reckon that China spent 1.5% of <small>GDP </small>on its own efforts in 2019. Last year Saudi Arabia disbursed sums equivalent to 20% of <small>GDP</small>.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Everyone’s a winner</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The problem with throwing around quite so much money is that it becomes difficult to see what is working and what is not. Manufacturers in Oman, making products from aluminium to ammonia, can obtain a factory rent-free at one of the country’s new industrial parks, buy materials with generous grants and pay their workers’ wages by borrowing cheaply from shareholders, which usually include the government. They can even draw on export subsidies to sell abroad at a lower cost. How is it possible to tell which comapanies will outlast all this cash, and which ones would collapse without it?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">One thing is already painfully clear. The private sector is yet to take off in the Gulf. Almost 80% of all non-oil economic growth in the past five years in Saudi Arabia has come from government spending. Although an impressive 35% of Saudi Arabian women are now in the labour force, up from 20% in 2018, overall workforce-participation rates across the rest of the Gulf remain low. Researchers at Harvard have found that legislation introduced in 2011, which stipulated Saudis should make up a set portion of a firm’s headcount—for instance, 6% of all workers in green tech and 20% in insurance—decreased productivity and did nothing to move the needle on private employment.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Ultimately, a few countries will make it to high-income status. Perhaps the <small>UAE</small>’s spending on <small>AI</small> will pay off. Perhaps new tech will make the world more dependent on nickel, to Indonesia’s advantage. India’s population is too young for growth to stagnate entirely. But the three strategies employed by countries looking to get rich—leaping to high-tech manufacturing, exploiting the green transition and reinventing the entrepot—all represent gambles, and expensive ones at that. Even at this early stage, a few lessons can be drawn.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="778" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_FND002.jpg" srcset="../image/20240106_FND002.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Vincent Kilbride</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The first is that the state is now much more active in economic development than at any point in recent decades. Somehow an economy must evolve from agrarian poverty to diversified industries that can compete with rivals in countries which have been rich for centuries. To do so requires infrastructure, research and state expertise. It may also require lending at below market rates. This means that a certain amount of state involvement in the process is inevitable, and that policymakers will have to pick some winners. Even so, governments are now intervening much more frequently. Many have lost patience with the Washington consensus. The benefits of its most straightforward reforms, such as independent central banks and ministries stuffed with professional economists, have already been reaped; the institutions that once enforced it (namely, the <small>IMF </small>and World Bank) are shadows of their former selves.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Today policymakers in the developing world take cues from China and South Korea. Few recall their own country’s interventionist follies. In the 1960s and 1970s it was not just those in East Asia that were enthusiastically experimenting with industrial policy; many in Africa were as well. For the best part of a decade, the two regions grew at a similar pace. Yet from the mid-1970s it became apparent that policymakers in Africa had made the wrong bets. A debt crisis kicked off a decade known as the “African tragedy”, in which the continent’s economies shrank by 0.6% a year on average. Later, in the 2000s, Saudi officials unsuccessfully spent big to foster a petrochemical industry, forgetting that shipping oil abroad was cheaper than paying people to work at home.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">A spanner in the works</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The second is that the stakes are high. Most countries have sunk enormous sums into pursuing their chosen path. For the smaller economies, such as Cambodia or Kenya, the result could be a financial crisis if things go wrong. In Ethiopia, this has already happened, with debt default accompanying civil war. Even bigger countries, such as India and Indonesia, will not be able to afford a second stab at development. The bill from their current efforts, should they fail, and the cost of ageing populations will leave them short of fiscal space. Wealthier countries are constrained, too, albeit by another resource: time. Saudi Arabia needs to develop before demand for its oil drops off, or else there will be few ways to sustain its citizens.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The third is that the manner in which countries grow is changing. According to work by Mr Rodrik, manufacturing has been the only type of work where poor countries have improved their productivity at a faster rate than rich countries, and so caught up. Modern industry may not offer the same benefit. Rather than spending time attempting to make factory processes marginally more efficient, workers in countries trying to get rich increasingly mine green metals (working in an industry with notoriously low productivity), serve tourists (another low-productivity sector) and assemble electronics (rather than making more complex components). All this means that the race to get rich in the 21st century will be more gruelling than the one in the 20th century. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/finance-and-economics/"><span>Finance and economics</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Guns and hoses</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Three surprises that could inflame commodity markets in 2024</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">What it would take for another bout of mayhem</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_FNP003.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">A</span><small>s Russia continues</small> to pound Kyiv, Western sanctions are beginning to cripple Arctic <small>LNG</small> 2, the aggressor’s largest gas-export project.

After a couple of years of double-digit rises, the Bloomberg Commodity index, a benchmark that covers raw-material prices, fell by more than 10% in 2023 (see chart). Oil prices, at a little under $80 a barrel, are down by 12% over the past quarter and are therefore well below the levels of 2022. European gas prices hover near their lowest levels in two years. Grains and metals are also cheap. Pundits expect more of the same this year. What, exactly, would it take to rock markets?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">After successive shocks inflamed prices in the early 2020s, markets have adapted. Demand, held back by suppressed consumption, has been relatively restrained. But it is the supply response to elevated prices, in the form of an increase in output and a reshuffling of trade flows, that makes the world more shockproof today. Investors are relaxed because supply levels for many commodities look better than they have since the late 2010s.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Take oil, for instance. In 2023 increased production from countries outside the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as <small>OPEC</small>+, was sufficient to cover the rise in global demand. This pushed the alliance to cut its output by some 2.2m barrels per day (b/d), an amount equivalent to 2% of global supply, in a bid to keep prices stable. Nevertheless, the market only just fell short of surplus in the final quarter. Kpler, a data firm, predicts an average oversupply of 550,000 b/d in the first four months of 2024, which would be enough to replenish stocks by nearly as much as they declined during the heated summer months. New barrels will come from Brazil, Guyana and especially America, where efficiency gains are making up for a fall in rig count.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In Europe manic buying since the start of Russia’s war and a mild winter have helped keep gas-storage levels at around 90% of capacity, well above the five-year average. Assuming normal weather and no big disruptions, they should remain close to 70% full by the end of March, predicts Rystad Energy, a consultancy, easily beating the European Commission’s target of 45% by February 1st. Ample stocks will hold gas prices down, not just in Europe but also in Asia, in turn incentivising more coal-to-gas switching in power generation everywhere. This will help lower coal prices already dulled by a huge ramp-up in production in China and India.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Mined supply of lithium and nickel is also booming; that of cobalt, a by-product of copper and nickel production, remains robust, dampening green-metal prices. Increased planting of grains and soyabeans (outside Ukraine) and clement weather are prompting pundits to project record output in 2024-25, after a lush 2023-24. That will push the average stocks-to-use ratio at food exporters, a key determinant of prices, from 13% to 16%, a level they last saw in 2018-19, says Rabobank, a Dutch lender.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Abundant supply suggests a sedate first half of the year. After that, surpluses could narrow. Non-<small>OPEC</small> oil output may level off. Delays at some American liquefaction-terminal projects, which were originally set to start exporting in 2024, will frustrate Europe’s efforts to restock gas. Low grain prices will crush farmers’ margins, threatening planting. Markets will be more exposed to shocks, of which three stand out: a sharp economic rebound, bad weather and military blow-ups.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Whether or not big economies avoid a recession, the pace of global growth is expected to be slow, implying modest growth in raw-material demand. Inflation is also expected to ebb, so commodities will have less appeal as a financial hedge. But a surprise is not impossible. One looks less likely in China, the usual bellwether of commodity markets, than in America, where interest rates might soon be cut and an <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/03/has-america-really-escaped-inflation">infrastructure splurge</a> is gathering pace. Liberum, a bank, calculates that a one-percentage-point rise in its forecast for annual global <small>GDP </small>growth would boost commodities demand by 1.5%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Freakish weather would have a deeper impact. Europe’s winter is not over yet, as evidenced by the cold snap that has just begun. A lasting freeze could force Europe to use an extra 30bn cubic metres of gas, or 6-7% of its usual demand, Rystad reckons. That could push the region to compete more aggressively with Asia for supplies. A climatic surprise would be more disruptive still in the wheat markets, not least if it were to affect Russia, the largest exporter, which has had bumper harvests since 2022. The larder to cover shortfalls is emptying. Owing to rising consumption, which is set to hit records this season, global wheat stocks are already headed for their lowest levels since 2015-16.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">What about war? Four-fifths of Russia’s food exports are ferried across the Black Sea, as are 2m b/d of crude. Naval tit-for-tats could jolt prices, though rising output from<small> OPEC</small>+, and international pressure to protect food shipments, would calm markets. Red Sea flare-ups, caused perhaps by a sustained American campaign against the Houthis, could cause a 15% spike in oil prices, says Jorge León of Rystad—though this may not last long either. War involving Iran and other Gulf states, where most of the unused production capacity lies today, is what would really cause chaos. The potential for terrifying prices of the sorts predicted in March 2022, when barrels at $200 seemed possible, could return.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It would take something extreme—or a mixture of less extreme but still unlikely events—to blindside commodity markets.

For now, though, it appears to have ended 2023 much as it passed the previous few years, with yet another expansion that defied forecasts. Recent data suggest that the economy grew at an annualised pace of 2.5% or so in the final three months of the year, more than twice the median expectation of analysts at the start of the quarter.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Although such momentum is welcome, it complicates the outlook as the Federal Reserve contemplates when to start cutting interest rates. America’s strength is broad-based. Investment in manufacturing facilities has soared to record highs, propelled by the Biden administration’s subsidies for electric-vehicle and semiconductor production. Elevated mortgage rates have led to big falls in sales of existing houses, but property developers have responded to the dearth of single-family homes on the market by ramping up building. The government has remained a backstop to growth—albeit a worrying one from the standpoint of long-term fiscal sustainability—with its deficit running at about 7% of <small>GDP</small>, which is virtually unprecedented during peacetime without a recession.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Most important of all, American consumers have remained indomitable, defying expectations of a retrenchment in personal spending. Two factors help explain their resilience. The stash of savings accumulated by households during the covid-19 pandemic, thanks to the government’s fiscal largesse, has continued to offer them a buffer. Economists at the Fed’s branch in San Francisco reckon that households had about $290bn of excess savings, relative to the expected baseline, as of November. Moreover, the tight labour market has led to robust wage growth, especially for lower-income workers, who, in turn, have a higher propensity to spend. As inflation has come under control their real wage gains look even more substantial.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">These various sources of strength contributed to America’s barnstorming third quarter in 2023, when it posted annualised growth of 4.9%. Some slowing was only natural after such a rapid expansion. As recently as early October analysts had pencilled in growth of just 0.7% in the final quarter of 2023. But the latest reading from a real-time model by the Atlanta Fed—which has proved to be a reliable guide for recent <small>GDP </small>figures—points instead to annualised growth of 2.5%. Although the reading will fluctuate as more data trickle in, the margin for error shrinks as the date of a <small>gdp </small>release nears; the next one is on January 25th. For 2023 as a whole growth is likely to be about 2.5%, impressive considering that most economists expected America to be flirting with recession.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">What makes the growth all the more striking is that it has come at the same time as inflation has receded. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation—the personal consumption expenditure (<small>PCE</small>) price index—hit 2.6% in November compared with a year earlier, down from 7% in mid-2022. Even more encouragingly, core <small>PCE </small>prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, have risen by just 2.2% on an annualised basis over the past three months, in line with the Fed’s target of 2%. The disinflation has been propelled by declines in goods prices as supply chains have recovered from pandemic disruptions.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This has given rise to a best-of-both-worlds scenario: resilient growth and fading inflation. Such a propitious combination might allow the Fed to cut rates in the coming months not because growth is weakening, but because it wants to avoid excessive monetary restraint. Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, seemed to give voice to these hopes after the central bank’s meeting in mid-December, when he said that rate cuts “could just be a sign that the economy is normalising and doesn’t need the tight policy”. His words fuelled a rally in both stocks and bonds.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Yet the strong growth points to a less pleasant scenario: that the fall in inflation is a false signal. Whereas goods prices have declined, those for many services continue to rise at a faster clip than their pre-pandemic trend. Housing prices even rebounded in 2023, despite mortgage rates climbing to 8%, their highest in two decades. With mortgage rates falling back below 7% in December, the prospect of a bigger re-acceleration in the property market looms large. An easing in financial conditions as a result of rate cuts would support economic growth but would also feed into renewed price pressures.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">If inflation rebounds the Fed would have little choice but to keep interest rates elevated, perhaps reviving the fears of a recession that have all but vanished. These risks help explain why John Williams, president of the New York Fed, poured cold water on the most feverish speculation about imminent rate cuts in the wake of Mr Powell’s comments last month. He said it was “just premature to be even thinking about that”. It is probably also premature to celebrate America’s escape from the past few years of brutal inflation with barely a bruise to its economy. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/finance-and-economics/"><span>Finance and economics</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Falling short</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">American stocks loiter near an all-time high</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Their performance this year will depend on the real economy</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_FNP501.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>t is the </small>first trading day of the year.

There is a big move in the share price of Apple, the world’s most valuable company, which sets off a move in the broader market. This dictates the tone for the rest of the day.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="740" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_FNC873.png" srcset="../image/20240106_FNC873.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Feeling déjà vu? For these facts describe both January 3rd 2022 and January 2nd 2024. In 2022 the mood on the first trading day of the year was approaching euphoria. The <small>s&amp;p </small>500 index of large American firms rose to 4,796 points, setting a new all-time high. Apple became the first company in the world to be worth $3trn, even if its market capitalisation then dipped. After the boom of 2021, the stockmarket appeared to be signalling that it was ready to continue its charge, surging to ever-greater heights.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">So far 2024 is looking rather different. When an analyst downgraded Apple to a “sell” recommendation on January 2nd, arguing that a slowdown in demand for the company’s phones would persist, the world’s biggest firm saw its share price fall by 4%. The rest of the market followed in short order. Instead of surging past the high-water mark set on January 3rd 2022, stocks slipped by 0.6%. Despite the roaring bull market that marked the end of 2023, the tone became anxious. Television talking-heads began to voice obituaries for the hot streak in American shares. The mood did not improve the following day, either. Stocks slid by another 0.8% on January 3rd.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="1550" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_FNC866.png" srcset="../image/20240106_FNC866.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">To understand whether such anxiety is warranted, consider the lightning-fast rally that preceded it. Stocks jumped by 16% in the final two months of 2023, a rise that represented two-thirds of the gain for the entire year. The <small>s&amp;p </small>500 rose for nine consecutive weeks, its longest winning streak since 2004. Having dipped in and out of a true “bull market” (defined as stocks rising at least 20% above their most recent low) throughout 2023, equities now tower some 31% above that level.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Many of the market moves over the past two years appear to be sensible. After Nvidia, which makes semiconductors, the next-best-performing firm, measured by its rise in market capitalisation, is Eli Lilly, which is at the forefront of another technological advance (in its case: weight-loss drugs). Meanwhile, manufacturing companies have benefited from the return of generous industrial policy under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. Although firms that mirror the wider economy, like banks and consumer retailers, have done well recently, they remain well below their levels in early 2022. Vaccine-makers such as Moderna and Pfizer have seen their prices collapse, reflecting the fall in the importance of covid-19. As such, the overall picture is not that of a market gripped by irrational exuberance.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But the recent surge has been broad-based, with nearly all types of firms soaring (see chart 1), which reflects economic conditions. Growth has been better than expected. After cutting earnings forecasts through most of 2023, analysts became more optimistic. Annualised core inflation, the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure, has more or less been on target for the past three months (see chart 2). All this has led to a big decline in interest-rate expectations. In October investors expected that one-year interest rates would be close to 5% towards the end of 2024. After lower inflation data and a doveish set of forecasts from the Fed, investors now think that they will be just 3.5% (see chart 3). They expect the Fed to cut as soon as March, and to keep cutting at almost every meeting in 2024.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Yet nerves are understandable. Financial markets often overshoot. And a lengthy hot streak is a sign that such an overshoot may have occurred. The most obvious risk to the bull market is if any of the rosy economic indicators become gloomier in 2024. The combination of falling rates, slow inflation and steady growth is Utopian for investors. Were strong growth to continue for too long, though, the Fed might be slower to cut rates than they hope. With less relentlessly upbeat news, it would only be natural for the market to give up some of its gains. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/finance-and-economics/"><span>Finance and economics</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Free exchange</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Robert Solow was an intellectual giant</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">His criticisms were energetic and witty, which could make them harder to take</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_FND000.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">E</span><small>nsconced in a</small> lorry, hidden from the enemy by the brow of a hill, the young Robert Solow decoded the radio signals of Nazi platoons across Italy. “We were very, very good at it,” he said. The trick was to get close to the enemy but not too close: near enough to pick up their transmissions, but not so near as to risk capture.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The codes were not fancy—it was “combat stuff”. But if they could be broken quickly, they might reveal an ammunition delivery that could be thwarted. The radiomen were not fancy either. Most were high-school graduates. Even Solow, who would go on to earn a Nobel prize in economics, the Presidential medal of freedom and a Portuguese knighthood, before his death on December 21st 2023, was “middle-middle-class”. He was educated at Brooklyn state schools. He preferred softball to books, and was destined for Brooklyn College until a teacher spotted his potential, broadened his reading, and encouraged him to apply to Harvard University, which he joined two years early and rejoined after the war.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Solow’s years as a soldier only strengthened his egalitarian streak. He declined to become an officer, so he would not have to boss anyone around. When the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (<small>mit</small>) offered him a job in 1949, he asked what the lowest paid professor earned, and accepted the same. When he served in President Kennedy’s Council of Economic Advisers, the Swiss embassy wanted to know his protocol rank. His answer was that he was a full professor at <small>MIT </small>and the government had no rank as high. Informed in the predawn hours in October 1987 that he had won the Nobel prize, his first instinct was to go back to sleep.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">What he craved was more precious than prizes: the esprit de corps that comes from membership of a small, highly motivated band of colleagues. “If you’re in a group that is doing good work, it’ll have a high morale. And if it has high morale, it’ll do good work,” he once said. As an economist, he liked formal models and mathematics. But nothing too fancy. Over-refinement reminded him of the man who knew how to “spell banana” but did not “know when to stop”. His strategy was to break big questions—about growth, resources, unemployment—into littler ones, in the hope that small answers would aggregate into larger ones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The <small>MIT</small> culture he embodied disdained hierarchy, cherished collegial lunches and made time for students, many of whom became illustrious friends. Four of Solow’s students later received their own sleep-disturbing calls from Sweden. Economics, Solow maintained, was a “handicraft” industry, often driven by the “extraordinarily powerful research apparatus” of one professor and one undergraduate assistant.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Something he liked about academia was that ideas, no matter how prestigious their source, could be scrutinised by anyone. His own criticisms were energetic and witty, which could make them harder to take. He found the “freshwater” school of macroeconomics, identified with the University of Chicago, preposterous, especially in its early incarnations, which assumed a “representative agent” could stand in for the many actors in an economy. To get into a technical discussion with freshwater types was like discussing cavalry tactics with someone claiming to be Napoleon, he said. The claim is absurd, however well they know their stuff.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The work that made his name began as criticism of the growth theories of the 1930s and 1940s. In these, investment added both to national spending and the economy’s productive capacity. There was no guarantee these additions to demand and supply would stay in line with each other. Moreover, excessive spending, by boosting demand, would inspire firms to invest even more, whereas inadequate investment would induce firms to spend still less. The economy was for ever poised on a “knife-edge” between deepening unemployment or intensifying labour shortages.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This precariousness was hard to square with the relatively stable progress of advanced economies like America, where even the Great Depression eventually ended. Solow showed that the knife-edge disappeared if economies could vary the capital-intensity of production. Strong investment would not then be destabilising. It would merely result in higher capital per worker.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">High investment would not, however, result in faster growth over the long run. At some point, capital would run into diminishing returns, leaving growth to be dictated by other factors. Solow calculated that capital accumulation could explain less than 13% of the growth in income per person in America from 1909 to 1949. The remainder was attributable to other forces, which he loosely labelled “technical change”. This vast unexplained portion of growth became known as the “Solow residual”.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Tough paternal love</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Although his work created reams of subsequent research, the father of growth theory was not impressed by many of his progeny. He was sceptical of statistical exercises that dissected growth rates across countries at every stage of development. Nor had he intended to imply that technological progress, which he did not model, fell entirely outside economics. A lot of innovation was “dumb luck”. And much of it emerged on the factory floor, “invented” by unheralded foremen. But some was the result of profit-driven investment in research. Later attempts to create formal theories of technological progress nevertheless asked more questions than they answered, he argued.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Part of the problem was that innovation is often peculiar and particular, whereas growth theorists strive for generality and abstraction. Solow, who had himself observed the research labs at General Motors and collaborated with the McKinsey Global Institute on industry-level studies of productivity, thought model-builders could learn from case studies and business histories. The aim was to “extract a few workable hypotheses” without getting lost in the detail. To understand how the economy works, to decode its secrets, you need to get up close, but not too close. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Read more from Free exchange, our column on economics:<br/></b></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/science-and-technology/"><span>Science and technology</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Big Bangalore theory</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Moon landing apart, Indian science punches far below its weight</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">The government needs to get out of the way and the private sector should step up</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_STP001.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">S</span><small>hivakumarriah V.</small> <small>wanted</small> to get his head examined.

There are a mere 26 researchers per 100,000 people, compared with an average of 32 in other lower-middle-income countries (see chart 2), 169 in China and 445 in America. India spends very little, too. At 0.65% of <small>GDP</small>, research and development (<small>R&amp;D</small>) funding is less than half that in other lower-middle income countries and the lowest of any major science power (see chart 3). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="2070" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20240106_STC761.png" srcset="../image/20240106_STC761.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Some would argue that this is as it should be. Despite its rapid economic and geopolitical rise, India remains a desperately poor country. A third of the world’s undernourished people live within its borders. Stunting afflicts one in three Indian children. And 10% of its 1.4bn people—more than the population of Mexico—live in extreme poverty, earning less than $2.15 a day. Unlike China or America, the argument goes, India can ill afford to spend money on useless things like research.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This is wrong-headed thrice over. Practicality is one counterargument. India faces immense challenges, in everything from sanitation and health care to sustainability and air quality. It can borrow ideas from other countries, but even those must be adapted into bespoke solutions by a skilled scientist class.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A philosophical counter to the argument is that theoretical breakthroughs without any obvious utility are valuable in themselves. New knowledge may not immediately lend itself to application, but it creates the foundations upon which “to attack practical problems in a scientific spirit”, as Abraham Flexner, the founding director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, home to 35 Nobel laureates, put it in an essay, “The usefulness of useless knowledge”, published in 1939. “To be sure, we shall thus waste some precious dollars,” Flexner wrote. But the return on investment can be enormous.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The last counter is economic. “If Apple manufactures something in India, billions of market capitalisation gets created somewhere else,” says Kris Gopalakrishnan, a co-founder and former <small>CEO</small> of Infosys, a software-services firm. “If India wants to create disproportionate growth in its wealth it will come from creating products and technology that Indian entities, Indian shareholders own.” </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Be in no doubt that India wants to create rapid growth. Mr Modi promises citizens that theirs will be a “developed country” by 2047, the 100th anniversary of its independence from British rule (see Finance &amp; economics section). In 2023, addressing the Indian Science Congress, a big annual conference, he explicitly linked that goal with the country’s research base, noting the role of “scientific power” in the country’s rise over the next quarter-century. The chief instrument to boost that power is the National Research Foundation (<small>NRF</small>), which was created by an act of Parliament last year. Modelled on America’s National Science Foundation, it envisions spending 500bn rupees ($6bn) over five years to overhaul and streamline Indian research funding.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Lessons to learn</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The challenges facing Indian science, many of which the <small>NRF</small> is intended to fix, are legion. But they can be sorted into four broad buckets. The first is money. India’s overall spending on<small> R&amp;D</small> is low by global standards, but the government is, surprisingly, blameless. Among other major science powers, the state rarely funds more than a quarter of a country’s overall <small>R&amp;D</small> spending, with the rest made up by industry and philanthropy. In India the government accounts for nearly two-thirds. Measured in terms of purchasing power, its dollar contribution is more than twice as high as the British government’s. It is the private sector that is not pulling its weight.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The low participation by private companies can be partly explained by the way government money is distributed. Nearly two-thirds of India’s <small>R&amp;D</small> spending is devoted to defence, the space programme and atomic energy, areas in which the state has not traditionally collaborated with industry. Government bodies and agencies perform more than half of <small>R&amp;D</small> in India, compared with 16% in China and under 10% in most other advanced economies. What money remains for academic research institutions is spread too thinly across far too many projects. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The second bucket is institutions. India has about 40,000 of them focused on higher education, but less than 1% engage in research. This small cadre of elite institutions produces much of India’s scientific output, while the majority of universities busy themselves with teaching. Few places do both well. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Moreover, most top-class institutions focus on specific disciplines, with few opportunities for collaboration across areas of science, let alone with the humanities. Nor do they work much with each other. The result is a science establishment that is less than the sum of its parts. There is an urgent need to address both “unnecessary duplication” and “the gaps which are in our <small>R&amp;D</small> system”, admits Ajay Sood, a physicist who now serves as the principal scientific adviser to the government of India, a position created in 1999.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The third major problem for Indian science is talent. At first blush this seems counter-intuitive. Researchers at the country’s top state institutions uniformly express satisfaction with their salaries, and India is teeming with people. At 31%, a larger proportion of its graduates studied <small>STEM</small> subjects than in America (20%) or even Israel (27%). But many students graduate with a poor education because of inadequate facilities, mediocre teaching and outdated curriculums, and many of the most talented go abroad. India loses people to overseas institutions at every stage: masters, <small>P</small>h<small>D</small> and post-doc. Once they have gone, it is difficult to get them back.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Last year India became the largest source of overseas graduate students in America, ahead of China. Including undergraduates, Indians now make up a quarter of all foreign university students in America. Of the roughly 2.5m immigrant <small>STEM</small> workers in that country, 29% are Indian. In <small>ai,</small> India is the source of 8% of the world’s top researchers; the proportion who work in India itself rounds to zero.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The <small>NRF</small> is designed to solve each of these problems. Officials say they would like to see India’s research-spending-to-<small>GDP</small> ratio more than double, to between 1.5% and 1.8%, with most of the new cash coming from industry. Research institutions will be incentivised to submit proposals for grants jointly with businesses that have committed their own funding. Of the <small>NRF</small>’s 500bn-rupee expenditure, only 140bn rupees, or 28%, will come from the state. For its part, the government says it will fund more high-risk projects.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A second strand of the <small>NRF</small> is connecting research institutions with each other and with universities. One way to do this is to set up “centres of excellence”, for example in quantum computing and communication at smaller universities, and then lure scientists from elite institutions with the promise of autonomy, equipment and a mandate to recruit the best researchers from anywhere in the world.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">To make that last bit possible, the government plans to raise funding for post-docs and to set up endowed professorships. At current salary levels, someone working in America “is getting ten times more money. So why should he come back? Or why should someone in India not go?” asks Akhilesh Gupta who, as a senior adviser in the department of science and technology, is a key figure in the implementation of the <small>nRF</small>. Good facilities and good professors should, the hope is, attract good students, helping to stanch the flow of talent to the West. Moreover, the National Education Policy of 2020 seeks to restructure higher education to produce better qualified undergraduates, too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The brain research centre in Bangalore, which predates <small>NRF</small> by several years, is an example of how elements of this plan could work in practice. It was set up as a public-private partnership with <small>IIS</small>c in 2014 thanks to the gift of a huge sum, by Indian standards, of 2.25bn rupees ($27m) over ten years by Mr Gopalakrishnan’s philanthropic organisation, Pratiksha Trust. Last year the foundation topped up funding with another 4.5bn rupees. The <small>CBR</small> has world-class facilities, scientists who are well paid, and a long-term mandate. Its shiny new building contrasts with the dated early- and mid-20th-century edifices elsewhere on the <small>IIS</small>c campus, whose interiors seem stuck in time. Yet the ranks of Indian philanthropists giving money to domestic research institutions can be counted on the fingers of two hands.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Riding on a silver dream</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Attracting researchers back to India will in part depend on the success of such partnerships. But they have to contend with a fourth constraint on Indian science: bureaucracy. The current system can be stifling for those with experience of academic life abroad. Consider the case of Yamuna Krishnan, a chemist. Queuing for coffee one day in 2005 at the University of Cambridge, where she was a post-doc, she overheard a fellow caffeine-seeker complain to his mate that “all science from China and India is copy-cattery”. “I was seething by the time I reached the front of the queue,” says Dr Krishnan. She returned to India because “I wanted to show that you can do something completely original.”</p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Technicians at work in a Serum Institute of India factory in Pune, India." data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20240106_STP002.jpg" srcset="../image/20240106_STP002.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">It’s in the blood</span><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Atul Loke/The New York Times/Redux/Eyevine</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">She quickly found a position at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore, a rare institution open to interdisciplinary appointments, and spent nearly a decade engineering <small>DNA</small> molecules into tiny machines inside biological cells. But eventually Dr Krishnan grew weary of bureaucratic hurdles to advancing her work, of the difficulty of collaborating with medical schools, and of demands for “deliverables” that lead to the creation of products. Despite having found applications for her work—which government funding bodies prize above all—she found it impossible to take forward. “I realised it was not going to be possible without me giving up being a scientist and becoming an administrator,” says Dr Krishnan. “The way academia is run by the government, it treats everybody like a crook.” She eventually moved to the University of Chicago.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Bureaucracy in the form of excessive control, overbearing regulations and limited autonomy is the chief complaint of India’s researchers and institute directors. Irritants range from the irksome to the infuriating. Guidelines around faculty-to-student ratios prevent institutes from hiring more researchers. Funds often take months to arrive only to be yanked away at the end of the financial year. A newish procurement system aimed at levelling the playing field for vendors across India’s single market has led to higher prices and slower deliveries of equipment. Purchases from overseas are even harder.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">As a result the quality of Indian science is uneven: it is world-class in theoretical fields such as string theory, but lags behind in disciplines that require equipment and experimentation. This may also be partly to blame for India’s poor show in translating research into applications.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A deep suspicion of the outside world is a common theme: arranging conferences with international visitors is made more fraught by the need to seek permission from central ministries. It is sometimes granted just a few days before the event. Government clearance is required for foreign trips longer than a few days. Non-Indian post-docs are subject to humiliating annual reporting requirements.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The sorts of rules that apply to running electricity departments or the postal service should not apply to running scientific institutions, grumbles Rajesh Gopakumar, a theoretical physicist and director of the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences in Bangalore. Umesh Waghmare, president of the Indian Academy of Sciences, says it is difficult even to meet officials to discuss these problems.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Researchers across disciplines are particularly exercised by what they see as an increasingly narrow focus on tangible outcomes: useful inventions rather than advances in basic science. “That has created a bit of a void when it comes to people who do research for curiosity,” says Arindam Ghosh, a physicist at <small>IIS</small>c. Expecting industry to take up the slack is a non-starter. “Right now the thinking is that for a country like India applied research is important. Of course it is. But so is basic research,” says Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, a self-made billionaire whose fortune comes from Biocon, a biopharmaceutical firm. “Let’s be honest: the private sector is not keen on funding basic research.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Dr Gupta says the government recognises that it must continue supporting fundamental science, expecting businesses to get involved only if they see clear benefit. But bureaucracy and a deep lacuna of trust are obstacles here, too. “The private sector thinks that all government people are corrupt. The government thinks that the private sector will waste [its] money. Both these perceptions are not wrong,” says Dr Gupta. “We do have people of these kinds on both sides. But I think we need new trust-building.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This is one area where the <small>NRF</small> falls spectacularly short. It was envisioned as an arm’s-length body whose board would be made up mostly of leading researchers, with a third of its members from industry and philanthropy. Instead, the <small>NRF</small> will be led by a board made up chiefly of officials, with the prime minister as president and ministers of education and science as vice-presidents. Actual scientists “may” be appointed, but no more than a handful. “It is not just this government. Indian governments have not historically understood the meaning of the word ‘autonomy’,” says one policy analyst.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Bureaucracy and state meddling are not uniquely Indian sins. But in few places has so much changed so little. In 1967 Ward Morehouse, an American intellectual, began writing a book looking at the first two decades of science in independent India. Entitled “Sarkar and Vigyan: Government and Science in India”, and edited by Jahnavi Phalkey, a science historian, it will be finally published later this year. In it, he notes that “a majority of the scientists and technologists we have, are made less effective through the lack of the right type of administrative support”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In 1998 A.P. J. Abdul Kalam, the father of India’s nuclear bomb, the country’s first principal scientific adviser, and a future president of India, co-wrote “India 2020”, a how-to guide for making India a developed country in a quarter of a century. (Sound familiar?) “All of us [scientists] have to keep pushing for...liberalisation and empowerment,” he wrote. The role of the government, meanwhile, “is to shed its presence and to empower various agencies within itself and also to empower private initiatives”. The <small>NRF</small> is clear in its intention to do the latter. But the government has yet to recognise that it is its own hand that is holding back the ascent of India’s science. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/science-and-technology/"><span>Science and technology</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Ghost ships</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Vast amounts of the world’s shipping sails unseen</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">New AI tools could help to eradicate blind spots on the oceans</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_STP502.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>n maritime legend</small>, the  traversed the world’s oceans undetectable except to the naked eye.

They then trained neural networks to recognise ships, based on their characteristic glare of reflected light, and used data such as distance from port, daily speed and nearby signs of marine life to classify their activity. While noting that most vessels shorter than 15m probably escaped their view, they estimated a false positive rate of less than 2% for those they did identify.</p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="694" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20240106_STM905.png" srcset="../image/20240106_STM905.png" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Though legitimate reasons exist for sailing incognito, the researchers point to a number of suspicious sites of activity (see map).

As attendance at the cinema declines, studios are <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/14/netflix-takes-a-swing-at-live-sport">finding new ways</a> to excite—and monetise—their fans outside their homes. From restaurants and art exhibitions to escape rooms and assault courses, film-makers are concocting novel ways to soak up demand. “There’s this insatiable appetite from those mega-fans,” says Marian Lee, Netflix’s chief marketing officer. “They want more. They’ll eat up anything you serve them.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It is a new take on an old playbook. In the 1950s Walt Disney drew a diagram of the mutually reinforcing pillars of his business: movies promoted television spin-offs, which fed demand for theme parks, which sold merchandise, which promoted movies, and so on. Other studios such as Universal copied the blueprint, creating parks and toys from the characters made popular by films.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Today these ventures are more than sidelines. The entertainment industry’s turbulent digital transition has left Hollywood more reliant than ever on rollercoasters and plastic lightsabres. In the last financial year Disney’s “experiences” division, which includes five theme parks and a fleet of cruise ships, contributed $9bn in operating profit, as its streaming business lost $2.5bn. At the same time the creative engine at the centre of Walt Disney’s diagram—the cinema—is <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/08/09/barbie-and-oppenheimer-show-that-blockbusters-could-save-the-cinema">sputtering</a>. Worldwide box-office takings for 2023 will be 20% below their pre-pandemic level; even before covid the average American was going to the movies three and a half times a year, down from five in 2000. As the silver screen fades, studios are losing their most powerful way of exciting audiences.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">So they are turning to new tactics. Some are doubling down on their parks. Warner Bros, a relative latecomer to the business, opened the world’s largest indoor theme park in Abu Dhabi in 2018. Disney announced in September that it would double its investment in its parks and cruises over the next decade, promising “Frozen” lands among other attractions. Universal is building a resort in Texas and in December said it had bought land for a possible park in Britain.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Studios are also devising new kinds of entertainment. Warner opened “Visions of Magic”, a Harry Potter “interactive art experience”, in Cologne in December and plans a similar show based on its <small>DC</small> Comics series in late 2024. Universal promises  an interactive “horror experience” in Las Vegas, based on its catalogue of scary movies, beginning with “Frankenstein” (1931).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Moviemakers are experimenting with food and drink, too. Warner’s eateries range from Park Row, a Batman-themed restaurant in London with a ten-course tasting menu priced at £195 ($246), to Central Perk, a “Friends” café that opened in Boston in November, serving coffee and Joey’s meatball sandwiches.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">“You’re trying to take the pulse of what folks are interested in,” says Peter Van Roden of Warner’s themed-entertainment division, who monitors merchandise sales, online clicks and box-office receipts to see which titles are good candidates for turning into such experiences. Social media, which encourage sharing and “<small>FOMO</small>” (fear of missing out), have made it easier for short-term “pop-up” experiences to succeed, he adds.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Netflix, the studio that is most sceptical of the cinema, has been among the most innovative at devising alternatives. Before it began organising live events, devotees of popular shows would come to premieres in home-made costumes, says Ms Lee. “We had all these breadcrumbs that were indicating to us that fans wanted a deeper way to get together…and then have something in-person to engage with,” she says. Netflix tested various formats, starting with a “Stranger Things” drive-through show during the pandemic, and has since held events including “Money Heist” escape rooms and “Bridgerton” balls.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The latest is a “Squid Game” experience in Los Angeles, where participants play six games based on the show, bossed around by suitably strict guards (there is no prize money, but no risk of execution either). ’s contestant came second, in part because he consumed fewer pre-game Korean cocktails from the adjoining bar than some of his rivals.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Unlike Disney, whose parks are priced with an eye on the bottom line, Netflix sees its events as ads for its shows. The brief is: “What can you give [fans] in between seasons, to really further that excitement that they have around these characters?” says Ms Lee. Prices reflect this: the cost of the 70-minute live “Squid Game” experience starts at $39, while tickets for the “Stranger Things” play are available from £20, cheap by West End standards. (Green-and-white tracksuits and cuddly demogorgons cost extra.) The streaming company does not report revenues for its events or merchandise, but on a recent earnings call described them as “small things”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Can the new in-person experiences make audiences fall in love with characters and stories as the cinema long has? Mr Van Roden, who declares himself a cinema fan, rejects the idea that they are substitutes. But their essential, shared characteristic is that they are communal. “Even if you’re not consciously connecting with the people in the room with you, it’s this common, human sort of electric connection, that you’re sharing it together,” he says.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">At the “Squid Game” assault course, the cocktail-fuelled contestants have been having such a riotous time together that Netflix has considered adding more soundproofing to the set. The growing number of live attractions from Hollywood means that audiences have more reasons than ever to get off the sofa and have fun with other people—even if the ultimate aim is to persuade them to spend yet more time in front of the television. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/culture/"><span>Culture</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->The art of over-sharing</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Social media’s online diarists have a long lineage</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Who are personal journals written for?</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_CUP003.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>he tales</small> embrace the mundane and the seismic, from being dumped by a boyfriend before the school prom to the sudden death of a parent. The tone ranges from cheesy to heartbreaking. The storytellers are “journal influencers”, mostly young women reading their teenage diaries to audiences online.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Some videos are mingled with other content, merging pre-teen dreams with make-up tips; others are simple shrines to past selves. One influencer, Carrie Walker (pictured), draws 1.2m views for a half-hour read on YouTube; the shorter content on TikTok’s #diarytok tag has reached 54m. And sharing secrets presents commercial opportunity: selling notebooks and pens on Amazon; auctioning copies of diaries on eBay.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Many people think about writing a diary, especially at New Year. Some start. Some even keep it up. But why write, and for whom? Whether a novice facing a blank page or a seasoned scribbler with years of good meals and gossip in irregular notebooks, almost any diarist has asked themselves that question.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Sally Bayley of the University of Oxford, author of “The Private Life of the Diary”, regards sharing on social media as the antithesis of diary-keeping. The journal is “an attempt to be honest with yourself”. It is “an internal territory, which you are mapping onto the page”, inseparable from privacy. Even Sylvia Plath, a “theatrical individual”, Dr Bayley notes, wrote a diary in order to “generate a voice in private”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Yet diaries have also long been shared, if more discreetly than on TikTok. Keeping a journal rose in popularity in the 19th century, especially among women. According to Cynthia Huff, an academic specialist in Victorian culture, diary-sharing then was “extremely common”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Diaries were read aloud, sent to friends or left open for visitors to peruse. “That distinction between public and private really doesn’t hold at all,” says Professor Huff. Some diaries served practical uses, sharing advice on self-improvement, pregnancy or childbirth. British women in the colonies often sent diaries back home. They were “creating an extended family through these diaries” and fostering an ocean-spanning sense of Englishness.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Many journal videos also create a sense of community. They share stories of isolation: of suffering homophobia, struggles with body image or early romantic obsessions. They poke fun at the distorted expectations of youth and the disappointments of adulthood, with the ear of sympathetic strangers.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Some diary-sharers go further. At Queer Diary, a series of events across Britain begun in 2020 by Beth Watson, a performer, <small>LGBTQ</small> adults read their old diaries to a live audience. The drama, confusion and mayhem of teenage life are performed to a sympathetic crowd. The celebration, Ms Watson says, is as important as the reflection.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The symbiosis of secrecy and celebration was perhaps best understood by Anaïs Nin, a 20th-century French-born American whose diary was an unapologetic exercise in self-creation. “I am in my Journal, and in my Journal only, nowhere else. Nothing shows on the outside. Perhaps I do not exist except as a fantastic character in this story.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Nin’s mix of fantasy and truth included an illegal abortion, extramarital affairs and, most notoriously, an incestuous relationship with her father. Her assertions of confidentiality—“you won’t say anything, will you”; “only my Journal knows it” —treat the reader as the sole listener.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">And yet, of course, Nin published her journal. Its scandalous content won her fame that her fiction had not. Her confessional texts penetrated the thin veil between public and privateThe diaries are a masterclass in broadcast secrecy, a megaphoned whisper.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">“We write to taste life twice,” Nin wrote, “in the moment and in retrospection.” She spent her last years reading her diaries to worshipping crowds. Like today’s influencers, she knew that retrospection tastes much sweeter in company. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/culture/"><span>Culture</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Back Story</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">A cultural guide to new year’s resolutions</h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">Lots of writers and fictional characters make them. Few keep them</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_CUP002.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">“E</span><small>very man</small> hath two birth-days,” proclaimed Charles Lamb, a Romantic essayist, in 1821: his personal one and New Year’s Day. “It is that from which all date their time,” Lamb wrote, “and count upon what is left.” The turn of the year was an occasion to “encounter pell-mell with past disappointments”. But it was also a prompt to look ahead to the years that remained to him, which seemed to pass ever more quickly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This one-two of retrospection and encroaching mortality often leads to self-reproach—for hours wasted, love undeclared and careless cruelties—and thence to vows for the future. Lamb’s was to squeeze life dry (and have another cup of wine). Collectively, he and other writers and storytellers offer a handy typography of new year’s resolutions, virtuous and violent, kept and otherwise.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Booze is a central theme, either as the subject of the resolution or the spur for it. At the close of 1661, for instance, Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary that he had sworn a “solemn oath” to abstain from wine. He did for a few weeks, finding he spent less money and frittered away less time “in idle company”. But he couldn’t keep it up and by February was hitting the bottle again. Likewise the heroine of “Bridget Jones’s Diary” resolves to drink less and “stop talking total nonsense to strangers”. She struggles on both counts.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In her case and others, drinking lubricates another type of resolution, namely an intent to find love. Like Christmas, only with more ambient smooching, New Year’s Eve is a lonely time for singletons. At one new year’s bash, the titular characters in “When Harry Met Sally” (pictured) resolve to be each other’s dates if they are still unattached a year later. When the day comes, Sally is marooned at a party stuffed with big Eighties hair and ruched dresses. Harry bursts in just before “Auld Lang Syne”, resolved to speak his heart. “It’s not because it’s New Year’s Eve,” he insists. But it kinda is.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Occasionally the resolution is not to get into a relationship but out of one. At the start of Ibsen’s play “A Doll’s House”, Nora is looking forward to a new year free of financial worries. Before it dawns, she is instead free of her dreadful husband.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">At least on screen and page, amatory resolutions seem easier to fulfil than the alcoholic kind. Then there are those that involve a full-on moral reformation. “I’ve decided to become a mensch,” says the protagonist of Billy Wilder’s sleazy-screwball comedy “The Apartment”. Having resolved to mend his ways—he has been lending his flat to his bosses to use for adulterous trysts—he duly gets the girl on New Year’s Eve. They consecrate their union with a game of gin rummy.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This is the night when some characters muster the gumption to reverse their fortunes. In “Trading Places”, the good guys ruin the baddies in a heist featuring a gorilla and a fancy-dress party on a train. Or it can inspire epiphanies: in “The Godfather Part II”, during new-year festivities in Cuba, Michael Corleone realises his brother Fredo has betrayed him. In a twisted parody of a midnight embrace, Michael kisses Fredo and grasps his neck in a form of reverse throttle. “I know it was you, Fredo,” he growls. In that fierce clinch, he resolves to be avenged and Fredo’s fate is sealed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Even when they don’t involve fratricide, new year’s resolutions can be ill-advised. It may be a natural time to assess your life, but it is also a febrile, maudlin and frequently inebriated one. The results can be foolish and unrealistic—whether they are can-do, mind-over-matter aspirations to do more, or plans to go easy on yourself and do less.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This last type of new year’s resolution has a logical flaw. If you are the sort of disciplined person who makes them in earnest, a promise to put your feet up may be hard to honour. Take Virginia Woolf. In 1931, she wrote in her diary, her first resolution was “To have none.” Next, she intended to be “kindly with myself”. Immediately afterwards, however, she pledges “To make a good job of ‘The Waves’,” an experimental novel published later that year. Woolf took it easy for two whole lines.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Sceptics might think Lamb made too much of January 1st. After all, the hinge between two calendar years is a fleeting and arbitrary punctuation in time, no more meaningful than any other moment. Then again, in the context of eternity, your entire life is a fleeting, arbitrary punctuation in time. This is as good an opportunity as any to glance back, peer forward and make improving resolutions. “Next week”, quipped Mark Twain at the start of 1863, “you can begin paving hell with them as usual.”<span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Read more from Back Story, our column on culture:<br/></b></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/economic-and-financial-indicators/"><span>Economic and financial indicators</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Indicators</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Economic data, commodities and markets</h1></section><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="1654" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20240106_INT101.png" srcset="../image/20240106_INT101.png" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="1654" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20240106_INT102.png" srcset="../image/20240106_INT102.png" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="1659" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20240106_INT201.png" srcset="../image/20240106_INT201.png" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="775" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20240106_INT401.png" srcset="../image/20240106_INT401.png" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div><body><section class="css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0"><div class="css-b4a1pi e1u9wqfn0"><span class="css-1te5c83 e11l78dl0"><a data-analytics="sidebar:section" href="/obituary/"><span>Obituary</span></a></span><span class="css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00"> | <!-- -->Bad blood</span></div><h1 class="css-6p5r16 e11fb5bd0">Gao Yaojie uncovered a scandal that shocked and shamed China </h1><h2 class="css-o55d57 elmr55g0">The gynaecologist and AIDS campaigner died on December 10th, aged 95</h2></section><img height="200" id="myImg" src="../image/20240106_OBP001.jpg" width="auto"/><section class="css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1" data-body-id="cp2"><div class="css-1qkdneh ee5d8yd2"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>he impoverished</small> farmers of Henan province, in the Yellow river valley of northern China, had no name for the illness that began to strike them down in the 1990s. They called it “the strange disease”. It made them weary and nauseous, spread a rash on their bodies and made sores grow in their mouths. And it made people vanish. Muscles and strength wasted away, so that men could no longer work the flat brown fields. Families dwindled and disappeared. Owners of new-built houses never moved in, leaving them empty. Some people, realising they were sick, simply ran away. Instead of crops, the fields sprouted mud-mound graves.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Local doctors were as puzzled as the victims. So in 1996 they called in Gao Yaojie to help. She was nearly 70 then, and technically she had retired. But her fund of medical knowledge, especially in obstetrics and female cancers, was formidable. She had always had a pretty good head on her shoulders. In 1950 she had been one of the first women to enter the Henan Medical School, walking with a limp which she never lost, because for six years as a child her feet had been bound to fit her for a daintier, idler life. Not for her, thank you.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">She identified the mystery illness with her first patient. It was <small>AIDS</small>, which was already prevalent in China’s big cities. The puzzle was how it had arrived here, in these remote rural places. The farm folk were not taking drugs or indulging in commercial sex. Her patient, though, had recently had a blood transfusion. <small>HIV</small>, the virus that causes <small>AIDS</small>, had come in that way.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Moreover it had come in officially. Mobile clinics had been sent by local government, on Beijing’s orders, to collect blood for hospitals and plasma for the market. There was always a shortage, so donors were told they could save China by giving some of their own. In return for 800cc they could get 45 yuan, enough to feed their families for a week. Half the donation, 400cc of blood, was injected back into them anyway. Donors lined up eagerly to oblige.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Soon enough, though, the trade was in the hands of “blood bosses”. Administration became slapdash. Equipment—centrifuges that separated plasma from blood, syringes and needles—was reused without being disinfected. The blood returned to arms was casually mixed up. At the same time, donors were not monitored. Some went several times a week, some twice a day. The result was the scene Dr Gao chanced on in one village: a young wife who had just hanged herself in front of her little son. She rushed to cut her down, but the body was already stiff. Nothing to be done.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">She naturally reported all this, loudly and often. But naming the disease caused fury among health officials in Henan. Their reputation was at stake. If <small>AIDS </small>was admitted, who would invest there? Local headmen refused to let their fiefs be “<small>AIDS</small> villages”. On every side, those in charge rushed to protect their careers and silence this meddling old woman. No one apologised or accepted responsibility. Instead, she was chased out of villages; but this only made her angrier and more determined.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Life had shaped her that way. In 1939 her landowner family had been driven by Communist guerrillas from Shandong into Henan, where they had to begin again. During the Cultural Revolution, as a capitalist “black element”, she was beaten up and paraded through the streets with a high papier mâché hat on her head and her shoes tied round her neck. She was imprisoned in the hospital morgue, and for seven years was made to clean toilets rather than practise gynaecology. After trying to kill herself with pills, and surviving, she vowed to spend her life helping others.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">That was why “Grandma Gao” kept going back to the villages. Over the next dozen years she visited more than 100, treating more than 1,000 families. She went as incognito as possible, in her dowdy dark secondhand clothes, and slept in the homes of the poor. No one paid her; she financed herself, draining  the family savings. No medicine she had could specifically treat <small>AIDS</small>, but she took along cough syrup, painkillers and diarrhoea tablets, to ease the symptoms, and fizzy drinks and sweets at Moon Festival. She did a lot of cuddling of infected children, to prove there was nothing to fear, arranged adoptions for <small>AIDS</small> orphans, and nagged local orphanages to accept them, which was uphill work.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Also in her bag were leaflets, printed at her own expense, about <small>AIDS</small> prevention. These were as unwanted as she was. Her phone was bugged, and she was followed. Even angrier now, she forged on. By 2003 she reckoned that 10m people in China had been infected with <small>AIDS</small> through blood-collection, 3m of them in Henan. It was a totally man-made catastrophe, the result of her own country’s penchant for “lies, fraud and fakery”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The central government, which at least acknowledged <small>AIDS</small> elsewhere, was little help to her in Henan. Blood-stations were banned, but the trade went briskly on, every night, in the back streets of the capital, Zhengzhou. Still the central government doubted her word. In 2003 she told a deputy prime minister, Wu Yi, that if she didn’t believe there was <small>AIDS</small> in the countryside she would rent a car herself, and take her there.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">By this time she was writing books about her work, but publishers in Henan were afraid to handle them. Although she was not allowed to speak to the press, she managed to tell her story to a reporter from the . In 2007 she even won an American award. But when she tried to go to Beijing to get a visa to travel abroad, Henan’s officials put her under house arrest.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">After 20 days they relented, and she went briefly to America. Two years later, she moved there for good. She could not adjust: never learning English, and so rarely leaving her flat in West Harlem. But at least her books could be published there. She also gave searing testimony, through an interpreter, to a congressional committee. Now she could freely speak truth to power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Having done that, she hoped to disappear. Her ashes would be scattered in the Yellow river and  flow away eastwards, body and name together. She would vanish as completely as those unknown villagers of Henan, before she had discovered them. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body><br><div class="pagebreak"></div>
