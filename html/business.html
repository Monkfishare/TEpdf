The contraction suggests that inflation, running at an annual rate of 3%, which is high by Japanese standards, is starting to cut into domestic demand. That complicates the central bank’s path to ending its massive monetary stimulus programme and policy of negative interest rates, which markets expect it to start undoing in the coming months.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="598" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20231118_WWC466.png" srcset="../image/20231118_WWC466.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Markets were cheered by news that America’s annual <b>inflation</b> rate dipped to 3.2% in October, the first decline in four months. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, also slowed, to 4%. In Britain annual inflation plunged from 6.7% in September to 4.6% in October, the lowest rate in two years. After a dismal few months, America’s main stockmarkets have roared back in November, as investors bet that lower inflation makes it more likely that central banks have finished raising interest rates.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Nvidia</b> unveiled its latest superchip for generative artificial intelligence, the <small>H200.</small> Delivering 141 gigabytes of memory at 4.8 terabytes per second, it has nearly double the capacity of its predecessor chip.
