Armed with some new statistics and the trends that explain them, that is what we <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/30/a-new-age-of-the-worker-will-overturn-conventional-thinking">set out to do</a>.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Our first design showed a lineman climbing towards prosperity. For the past seven years real weekly earnings for workers at the bottom of America’s pay distribution have been growing faster than those for people at the top. Since the covid-19 pandemic this wage compression has reversed 40% of the pre-tax wage inequality that emerged during the previous 40 years.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In Britain the inequality-reduction agenda is often referred to as “levelling up”. So in a new iteration of that first image, we put the muddy-booted lineman standing on wads of cash. A decade ago Thomas Piketty, a French economist, became a household name by arguing that inequality had surged. Now increasing attention is being given to research that finds that, after taxes and government transfers, American income inequality has barely increased since the 1960s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The blue-collar bonanza is not just an artefact of the statistics; it makes intuitive sense, too. Demand, demography and digitisation are all benefitting workers in rich countries: their economies are running hot, which keeps labour markets tight; the supply of working-age people is falling; and technology is replacing clerical skills even as the sorts of things that only people can do, such as manual labour and care work, remain untouched.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">We felt that a design showing the lineman’s jewel-encrusted hard hat said all this best. Although <i>The Economist</i> is dedicated to free-market liberalism, we ended up choosing the cover that did the most to heighten the contradictions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">We wrangled over the subtitle, though. Income inequality is much more than an argument among wonkish economists. The unshakeable conviction that it is growing has been a spur to political projects on both the left and the right, from the interventionism of Joe Biden to the populism of Donald Trump. We wanted something pithy that put across this wider context. In the end we sacrificed pith for punch.</p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="1684" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231202_DE_US.jpg" srcset="../image/20231202_DE_US.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Leader</b>: <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/30/a-new-age-of-the-worker-will-overturn-conventional-thinking">A new age of the worker will overturn conventional thinking<br/></a><b>Finance and economics</b>: <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/28/welcome-to-a-golden-age-for-workers">Welcome to a golden age for workers<br/></a><b>Free exchange</b>: <a href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/30/income-gaps-are-growing-inexorably-arent-they">Why economists are at war over inequality</a></p><hr class="css-11rnjw e10jdj00"/><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For the first time since Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine on February 24th 2022 he looks as if he could win. He has put Russia on a war footing and strengthened his grip on power. He has procured military supplies abroad and is helping turn the global south against America. Crucially, he is undermining the conviction in the West that Ukraine can—and must—emerge from the war as a thriving European democracy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Our <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/30/putin-seems-to-be-winning-the-war-in-ukraine-for-now">editorial</a> draws on reporting about how Mr Putin has transformed his country. The president now tells his people that they are in a struggle for survival against the West. Ordinary Russians may not like the war, but they have become used to it. The elite have tightened their grip on the economy and are making plenty of money. Mr Putin can afford to pay a lifetime’s wages to the families of those who fight and die.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">That transformation was behind two early ideas, featuring St Basil’s Cathedral bristling with bullets and a grenade-carrying matryoshka doll. But these covers risked confusing Mr Putin’s advantage with Russia’s. In fact, we should be in no doubt that, whatever happens next, Russia’s president blighted his country on the day he invaded its neighbour. We used St Basil’s and the doll to illustrate the <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/30/how-putin-is-reshaping-russia-to-keep-his-war-machine-running">briefing</a> instead.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">That left us with two ideas that focused squarely on Mr Putin. In one his dark suit was restitched as camouflage. The image said that his presidency was defined by conflict. Having strengthened his control, he could remain in power for years. If he does, he will continue to threaten war because that is his excuse for domestic repression and his own people’s suffering. Without war, the hollowness of his rule would be on full display. The design we eventually went for was stronger. Partly thanks to its colours, partly because it was a collage, it had a Constructivist feel.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The West could do a lot more to frustrate Mr Putin. If it chose, it could deploy industrial and financial resources that dwarf Russia’s. However, fatalism, complacency and a shocking lack of strategic vision are getting in the way, especially in Europe. For its own sake as well as Ukraine’s, the West urgently needs to shake off its lethargy.</p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="1684" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231202_DE_UK.jpg" srcset="../image/20231202_DE_UK.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Leader: </b><a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/30/putin-seems-to-be-winning-the-war-in-ukraine-for-now">Putin seems to be winning the war in Ukraine—for now<br/></a><b>Europe: </b><a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/28/russia-is-poised-to-take-advantage-of-political-splits-in-ukraine">Russia is poised to take advantage of political splits in Ukraine<br/></a><b>Europe:</b> <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/27/ukraines-new-enemy-war-fatigue-in-the-west">Ukraine’s new enemy: war fatigue in the West</a></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><i>For subscribers only: to see how we design each week’s cover, sign up to our weekly <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/cover-story">Cover Story newsletter</a>.</i></p></div></section></body>
