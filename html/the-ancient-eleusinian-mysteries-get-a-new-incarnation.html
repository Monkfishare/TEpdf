It was forbidden on pain of death to disclose what happened. All that is known is that having fasted for three days, initiates would quaff a drink and then be presented with “things enacted, things shown, things said” that celebrated the return of the goddess Persephone from her abduction to the underworld.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For the past year, modern Greece’s mandarins have tried to turn the location, now called Elefsina, into a new intangible asset, hosting their own wondrous variety of happenings, from multi-media installations and dance displays to a conference of scholars, including psychedelic medicine buffs, who debated the Eleusinian mysteries. Elefsina has been one of three European “capitals of culture” during 2023.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The year-long festival’s focus was not merely on the under-visited archaeological site, but also the hardscrabble new town of some 30,000 blighted by steelworks, cement factories and oil refineries, as well as a graveyard for ships. This grim backdrop has not deterred bold experimentation. Katerina Gregos, the doyenne of Greece’s contemporary-art curators, invited creative types from nine countries to assemble a show that used underwater film clips, random industrial artefacts, gravestones and wrappings from munitions to comment on migrant labour, shipwrecks and arms factories.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Next month’s closing ceremony will be a beginning, not an end, insists Nana Spyropoulou, the festival’s administrator. The stress will be on the use of semi-ruined buildings which have been rehabbed. Buffing up the whole of the Sacred Way, part of it now a motorway, is not yet planned; but it should be.<span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body>
