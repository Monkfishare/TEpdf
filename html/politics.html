Some delegates attending <small>COP28</small> had hoped for a more forceful phrasing on phasing them out. Dirty fuels, especially coal, will be used for some time. The words of the text need to be put into action, but still, the industry minister of the United Arab Emirates, which hosted <small>COP28,</small> described it as historic.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The <small>UAE </small>recently<small> </small>held a mass trial of more than 80 <b>dissidents </b>on fabricated charges of supporting terrorism, according to  Amnesty International. The government does not allow charges or judgments concerning political prosecutions to be made public or reported on.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In a rare criticism, Joe Biden described <b>Israel’s</b> bombing campaign in <b><a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">Gaza</a></b> as “indiscriminate” and is pressing its government to scale back its operations. Jake Sullivan, America’s national security adviser, has been dispatched to Israel to discuss a timetable to that end. The <small>UN</small> General Assembly voted for a <b>ceasefire</b>. Israel’s foreign minister said a ceasefire now would be a “gift” to Hamas, and that the war will continue “with or without international support”. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Ernest Bai Koroma, a former president of <b>Sierra Leone</b>, has been placed under house arrest, according to the opposition. Mr Koroma has been questioned by police about what the government describes as an attempted coup in November that was mounted by his former bodyguards.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Luis Caputo, the new economy minister in Javier Milei’s cabinet in <b><a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/12/13/javier-milei-implements-shock-therapy-in-argentina">Argentina</a></b>, announced a sweeping package of measures. The official exchange rate of the peso was devalued by half and public spending was slashed. The <small>IMF,</small> which has supported the beleaguered economy with a $43bn loan, welcomed the shock therapy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Irfaan Ali, the president of <b>Guyana</b>, agreed to meet Nicolás Maduro, <b>Venezuela’s</b> autocratic leader. Earlier this month Venezuela held a dodgy referendum, in which 95% of respondents agreed to annex two-thirds of its neighbour. Mr Ali has repeatedly stated that “Guyana’s land boundary is not up for discussion.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Efforts by a circle of elites to keep <b>Guatemala’s</b> president-elect Bernardo Arévalo from taking power in January intensified. The attorney-general said the electoral result should be nullified because of fraud (of which there is no evidence). But the electoral tribunal reiterated that the results are “unalterable”. The United States condemned the attempt to undermine Guatemala’s troubled democracy.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">The new American elite</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Harvard’s governing body decided that Claudine Gay should remain president of the university, after she came under intense criticism for her ambiguous answers at a congressional hearing into the surge of <b><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/12/12/american-universities-face-a-reckoning-over-academic-freedom">antisemitism</a></b> on American campuses. But Elizabeth Magill stepped down as president of the University of Pennsylvania. She got in trouble at the same hearing responding to a question about the genocide of Jews.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The House of Representatives formalised an<b> impeachment</b> investigation into Joe Biden that centres on the business dealings of his son, Hunter, who said he would be willing to testify to a public committee.

The chancellor said that the budget, which contains lots of new green levies, would retain money for supporting Ukraine and adhere to the “debt brake”, which limits government debt.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Alexei Navalny</b> has been removed from the penal colony where he had been imprisoned on trumped-up charges of supporting extremism, according to his spokeswoman, and has not been heard from for days. It was expected that Russia’s opposition leader would be placed in an even harsher prison. Meanwhile Vladimir Putin confirmed that he would stand for a fifth term as president in 2024. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Donald Tusk attends the cabinet swearing-in ceremony at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw, Poland" data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231216_WWP002.jpg" srcset="../image/20231216_WWP002.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Reuters</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Donald Tusk was sworn in as <b><a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/14/donald-tusk-must-undo-years-of-populist-subversion-in-poland">Poland</a>’s</b> prime minister, bringing an end to eight years of rule under the populist Law and Justice (<small>P</small>i<small>S</small>) party. Mr Tusk heads a coalition of centrist parties, which together took the most seats at an election in October, though <small>P</small>i<small>S</small> remains the single biggest party in parliament.

Volodymyr Zelensky visited Washington to drum up more financial support for Ukraine’s defence against Russia. The Ukrainian president met politicians in Congress in the face of Republican opposition to giving any more money to his country. His pleas fell on deaf ears. </p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Rishi Sunak survived a vote on his controversial bill declaring <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/12/13/how-a-rwandan-gambit-consumed-the-conservative-party">Rwanda</a> to be a safe country for asylum-seekers to be sent to.

The biggest beast to fall was<b> </b>Matsuno Hirokazu, the powerful chief cabinet secretary. All four are members of a faction in the Liberal Democratic Party that supported Abe Shinzo before his assassination in 2022 and which is at the centre of allegations about missing party funds. The approval rating of Kishida Fumio, the prime minister, has plummeted since the scandal broke a month ago.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">An <small>MP</small> in <b>Thailand</b> was sentenced to six years in prison under the country’s <i>lèse-majesté</i> law.
