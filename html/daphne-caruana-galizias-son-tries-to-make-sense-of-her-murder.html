Hutchinson Heinemann; £14.99</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">W</span><small>hen Daphne Caruana Galizia</small>, a Maltese journalist, was <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/12/11/the-prime-minister-and-the-murdered-journalist-inside-malta-a-nation-on-the-brink">assassinated by a car bomb</a> in 2017, the 53-year-old had been close to uncovering a huge government scandal (subsequently exposed by a journalist collective named in her memory). It involved ministers, a power-station contract and an alleged system of kickbacks, which was said to have cost Maltese taxpayers millions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In “A Death in Malta”, Paul, the youngest of her three sons and a journalist himself, writes movingly about his mother and her work, as well as his family’s ongoing pursuit of justice. Caruana Galizia was a towering and unusual figure in Malta; her death <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2017/10/21/the-death-of-a-crusading-journalist-rocks-malta">provoked a global outcry</a>.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Bored by domestic life, Caruana Galizia started in journalism as a young mother in the 1980s, soon becoming both the island’s first female columnist and the first reporter to write under her own name. (Maltese papers then eschewed bylines, so great was the fear of repercussion.) She first wrote about low-level criminality, before investigating <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2017/05/11/corruption-allegations-trouble-tiny-malta">state corruption</a>. Her renown grew quickly, and her blog sometimes attracted a larger audience than the combined circulation of the national daily newspapers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">But her high profile also provoked larger torrents of hate. Libel lawsuits, easy to file in Malta, piled up; at the time of her death, she faced 42 civil and five criminal cases. She suffered “churning nerves” in the face of so much hostility and was reserved and softly spoken, which was at odds with the “bravura of her writing”. For years, the family had lived with threats. The author recalls how his mother would check their car for bombs, before taking him and his brothers to school. Their dog had its throat slit, and their house was almost burned down twice in arson attacks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For years the European Union did not pay much heed to its smallest member state, despite the collapse of Malta’s rule of law. But Caruana Galizia’s death prompted scrutiny of the Mediterranean island. “A Death in Malta” expertly lays bare the island’s webs of corruption and hate, explaining how Caruana Galizia came to be killed and how the state tried to shield those behind her death.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Six years after she was blown up, too little has been done to hold those responsible to account. Two hitmen were given 40-year prison sentences for her murder in 2022, but no one has been condemned as the mastermind. Yorgen Fenech, a former director of Electrogas, a utility company, was arrested in 2019 and<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/12/05/maltas-prime-minister-is-ousted-by-a-murdered-journalists-work"> charged with complicity</a> in her assassination. He maintains his innocence and has yet to stand trial. This is a story of journalistic impact but elusive justice. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><i>For more on the latest books, films, <small>TV </small>shows, albums and controversies, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/23/introducing-plot-twist-our-new-culture-newsletter" target="_blank">Plot Twist</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter</i></p></div></section></body>
