Panicked civilians began to flee. The attack by fighters from the Rapid Support Forces (<small>rsf</small>), a paramilitary force, was met with air strikes by the Sudanese Armed Forces (<small>saf</small>), the regular army. After a brief lull in which the <small>saf</small> claimed victory, gun-toting militiamen then stormed into the city centre. As they did so, <small>saf</small> soldiers abandoned their posts and slunk away to the south.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The fall of Wad Madani, about 200km south-east of Khartoum, the capital, comes five years after pro-democracy street protests erupted that eventually forced out Sudan’s long-time dictator, Omar al-Bashir. But Sudan’s political transition was derailed in 2021 by a coup staged jointly by the <small>rsf</small> and the <small>saf</small>. In April their edgy alliance collapsed into civil war. Some 7m people have been displaced within Sudan. Another 1.4m have fled to neighbouring countries, many to Chad, after genocidal violence against the Masalit, a black African tribe, by the <small>rsf</small> and allied militias.</p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="796" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20231223_MAM994.png" srcset="../image/20231223_MAM994.png" style="color:transparent" width="608"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The latest fighting is worsening a humanitarian catastrophe. As many as 300,000 people have fled Gezira state, of which Wad Madani is the capital, in just four days, the <small>UN </small>estimates. Many are fleeing for a second time, since nearly 500,000 people had escaped there, mostly from bloody chaos in Khartoum. Cities farther south, where they may now flee, may not be safer for long. Those remaining in Wad Madani fear atrocities by the <small>rsf</small>, which has a record of carrying out massacres and rapes, and air raids by the <small>saf</small>.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Wad Madani was also an important staging-point for sending aid and was one of Sudan’s few remaining medical hubs. No longer. Scores of badly disabled babies who had been relocated from Khartoum after their orphanage had been caught in the fighting are again in desperate need.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The city had been considered an <small>saf</small> stronghold. That it fell so swiftly piles the pressure on General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the <small>SAF</small>’s head.  After the city’s fall, rumours swirled of a coup against him, which the <small>saf</small> seemingly sought to deny. Instead the <small>saf</small> announced an investigation into why its troops fled the city.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">In fact the army has been in retreat for months. General Burhan himself left Khartoum for Port Sudan, in the north-east, while the <small>rsf</small> seized control of most of the big cities in Darfur, in the west. “<small>saf</small> has essentially not won a major battle of this war,” explains Alan Boswell of Crisis Group, a think-tank, who is based in Nairobi. One reason for the <small>rsf</small>’s success is backing from the United Arab Emirates (<small>uae</small>), which has reportedly been shipping weapons to it via Chad. (The <small>uae</small> denies this.) Egypt, which General Burhan hoped would prop up his side, has failed to keep pace, in part as a result of its own mounting economic woes.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Many worry Sudan could end up like Libya, split into chunks controlled by rival factions. It could get even worse. The <small>rsf</small> may try to seize much more of the country, perhaps all of it. What may be left standing in Sudan is unclear, cautions Mr Boswell. The <small>rsf</small>’s next move may be to try to seize all the major southern cities.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Still, the <small>rsf</small> could get bogged down in the south. And the <small>saf</small> is not its only rival. In November many feared a big battle for el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state. That has not yet materialised, despite some skirmishes, in part because other former rebel groups announced that they would defend the city from the <small>rsf</small>.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Diplomacy has plainly foundered. On December 9th a regional summit failed again. Talks may have a chance if the <small>rsf</small> gets stuck or if it surges dramatically forward and the <small>SAF </small>is forced to sue for peace. Even then, a deal would be hard to strike. Western governments have been distracted by crises elsewhere. Regional ones have been just as ineffective. “There hasn’t been a major ceasefire push since the first few weeks of the war,” laments Mr Boswell. “It’s been a giant mess.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body>
