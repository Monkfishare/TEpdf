Her voice is so magnetic and emotive it would enchant audiences whatever tune she sings. Already a star in Norway, she deserves wider fame.</p><aside class="css-d2tu32 e1x5fpv0" data-component="infobox"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><a href="https://www.economist.com/best-of-the-year"><i>Read more of our guides to the cultural treats of 2023</i></a></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“False Lankum”. </b>By Lankum</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/04/03/irish-folk-music-is-enjoying-a-revival">new wave of Irish folk</a> is producing lots of stirring music, but none quite so stark as that on Lankum’s fourth album. “Go Dig My Grave” might be the most uncompromising opening track of any album this year. (You are not likely to hear the band’s music in an advert for Irish tourism.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“Fountain Baby”. </b>By Amaarae</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This album, by a Ghanian-American singer, is fizzy and sweet. The combination of Afrobeats, pop and <small>R&amp;B</small> gives “Fountain Baby” an inventive, wonderfully contemporary sound.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“Gold”.</b> By Cleo Sol</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Cleo Sol, a British singer-songwriter, released two albums in September, both excellent: “Heaven”, a tour of the mellow soul of the 1970s, and “Gold”, which is the better of the two, offering songs more varied in tone.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“Guts”. </b>By Olivia Rodrigo</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The former Disney star surfs the wave of nostalgia for the pop-punk of the 1990s with a snappy, snarky second album. You can hear her love of <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/07/25/can-superstars-like-beyonce-or-taylor-swift-spur-inflation">Taylor Swift</a> in some of the delivery; “Guts” also connects with an audience of young women seeking a voice that echoes their lives.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“Heavy Heavy”. </b>By Young Fathers</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">An album both accessible and experimental, by a multi-ethnic trio from Scotland. “Heavy Heavy” sounds as though it comes from everywhere and nowhere. One minute you get a glam-rock beat evocative of the 1970s, the next ululating vocals in Zimbabwe’s Shona language.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“Hit Parade”.</b> By<b> </b>Róisín Murphy</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The release of “Hit Parade” was overshadowed by the culture wars, after Róisín Murphy offered her opinions on puberty blockers. But behind the headlines lies a coolly confident album of dance-pop, full of infectious, summery melodies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“Manzanita”.</b> By Shana Cleveland</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This album limns a poor, rural part of California that does not get much attention in pop. The music is beautiful, evoking genres popular in the 1960s, such as baroque pop and psychedelic folk. Ms Cleveland’s voice is soft and affectless.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“New Vietnam and Singles”. </b>By Civic</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Civic offers a raucous take on garage punk. The band belongs to an Australian lineage whose forebears include Radio Birdman, The Saints and The Scientists. This album is both a throwback and wildly exciting.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“Perfect Saviours”. </b>By The Armed</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">On their fifth studio album, this hardcore-punk collective completed their transformation from shouty thrashers to experimental-pop group. “Perfect Saviours” shows off their melodic sensibilities.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“The Price of Progress”.</b> By The Hold Steady</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The band’s late-career revival continued with their ninth album. Craig Finn no longer sings about youngsters ending up in the emergency room after taking too many drugs. On “The Price of Progress” he tells of older people losing control of their lives in less dramatic ways.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“The Record”. </b>By Boygenius</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The rare “supergroup” that is bigger than the sum of its parts. No indie fan would be startled by their debut album, but what was new about it was the way it became a rallying point for young queer people of all stripes. Crucially, the songs were superb.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“Scaring the Hoes”. </b>By Danny Brown and JPEGMafia</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This album defies description: a barrage of words from Danny Brown, a rapper, is accompanied by frenetic production from JPEGMafia. Here hip-hop is not party music but an exploration of how far the genre can be pushed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“Strays”. </b>By Margo Price</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">At the beginning of her career Margo Price sang hardscrabble, often autobiographical, country. Her style has since evolved into a winning amalgam of modern Americana and classic rock. “Strays”, which incorporates synthesisers and drum machines, is a triumph.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>“Sundown”. </b>By Eddie Chacon</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">It had long seemed as though Eddie Chacon would only be known as one half of Charles &amp; Eddie, the duo behind “Would I Lie to You?”, a hit in 1992. But a solo career that began in 2020 has now yielded a second short, glorious album of retro soul, both jazzy and introspective. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body>
